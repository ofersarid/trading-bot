in this video I will test the very
profitable trading strategy with only
one indicator shared by hypertrade to
find out how profitable it really is for
the back testing I will set the initial
account size at 100 and I'll be risking
two percent of my account portrayed in
order to make three I will also try to
improve this strategy in a second part
of this video so stay tuned for that the
test will be done on the price of
ethereum usdt on a 15 minute time frame
okay now let's go ahead and search for
the indicator the strategies based on
for that let's click on the indicators
Tab and type in Marcus structure break
and Order

It's Gonna Be disindegator by m-ray KB
the gaita basically shows the market
structure break and all the blocks a
bearish breakout occurs when the price
action is breaking the most recent lower
low this is when the indicator will
print an MSB Red Label which stands for
Market structure break
on the other hand when the price action
is breaking the most recent higher high
we have a bullish Market structure break
the indicator also consists of the
zigzag which helps us identify the highs
and lows in the market and finally we
have these order blocks these areas can
be used as support and resistance in
this strategy though we're going to be
using these areas to enter long and
short trades so the rules for entering a
long trade are as follows first the
price action must cross and close into
the bullish order block this means that
the closing price of at least one
Candlestick must be inside a green box
and the second condition is to have the
Candlestick crossed enclosed above the
bullish order block
a buy order will be placed at the close
of the trigger Candlestick the stop loss
is going to be set at the recent swing
low
and we're going to be targeting one and
a half times the risk

here's one more example for a long trade
we see the bearish Candlestick just
crossed in close into the bullish order
block now we're waiting for the bullish
candlesticks to cross and close above it
they're also entering a cell position
are exactly opposite first at least one
Candlestick must be closed inside a
bearish order block second we enter a
short position as soon as the price
action crosses and closes below this red
box

the stop loss will be set at the recent
swing High the take profit Target at one
and a half times the risk
thank you

okay let's take a look at one more cell
example here we see the price action is
approaching the bearish order block as
we already know in order to enter a cell
position we need to have the Candlestick
crossed enclosed inside the bearish
order block first
there we go we just had a breakout and a
signal to go short


foreign
s issued by this strategy and I found a
major problem so here we see the price
action just got into the bullish order
block and on the very next Candlestick
we had a signal to take a long position

and the reason this trade in turn out to
be successful is because we took a long
position when the price action was
making lower lows and lower highs the
fact that we're not taking into account
the zigzag button when making a trading
decision is actually a big disadvantage
if you watched my previous videos you
already know that some of the best
strategies I have on a channel are
actually the ones that follow the trend
and this coincidence is not random you
see when the trend Direction has been
confirmed it's easier for you to win the
trade because the market participants
are more likely to continue to push the
price in the prevailing direction of the
trend that's why we always need to
analyze the market structure first
before making a trading decision but
anyway let's actually do the back
testing to find out how profitable this
strategy is

thank you

okay the back testing is finished and
here are the results the win ratio for
the strategy is only 54 this is
definitely really low for such a risky
reward ratio but despite low win rate
the strategy is still making quite a bit
of money The Profit factor is 1.76 and
we had six consecutive wins against four
consecutive losses and the maximal
Jordan was 13.32 so overall I give the
strategy a score of 6 out of ten I
wouldn't say the strategy is bad but it
could be much better if we made some
minor adjustments so in order to improve
the strategy I will add one more entry
rule that will hopefully change
everything so the rules for entering a
long trade are as follows first the
price action was getting to the bullish
order block Zone second we need to have
a breakout where the Candlestick crosses
and closes above the zone and third the
price action must make at least two
higher highs and two higher lows before
the Breakout

this is an ultimate confirmation that
the market is an uptrend
the stop loss will be sat slightly below
the recent swing low
the take profit Target will stay the
same which is one to one and a half
times the risk
this way the probability of a successful
entry will dramatically increase here's
another example for a valid long entry
we see the price action just got into
the bullish order block and then it
crossed then it closed above it and the
market formed two higher lows and two
higher highs before the breakout if the
price action breaks below the most
recent higher low at a time it makes the
pullback the setup automatically becomes
invalid
every day
another good way to protect yourself
from taking losing trades is to make
sure that you have enough room for the
take profit Target to be hit before the
price action bounces off the bearish
order block all right now let's learn
the cell positions so first the price
action must get into the bearish order
block area second we need to have a
breakout where the price action crosses
and closes below it and third there must
be at least two lower lows and two lower
highs before the market makes the
Breakout

foreign

ly above the recent swing High

and the take profit Target stays the
same

also make sure you do not take a trade
if the price action breaks above the
most recent lower high before a signal
to take a sell position this usually
indicates that the bearish trend is not
strong enough for you to enter the trade
okay now let's move on to the second
back testing to see if the results are
any better

all right right away we can see that the
win rate has increased to 76 percent the
profit and loss is also looking really
good the profit factor is 4.75 and we
had 16 consecutive wins against only two
consecutive losses so yeah I'm really
happy with these results the strategy is
definitely worth our time if you have
any ideas on how to improve the strategy
