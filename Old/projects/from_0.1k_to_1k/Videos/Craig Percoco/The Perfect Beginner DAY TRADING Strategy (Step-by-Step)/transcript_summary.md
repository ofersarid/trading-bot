## Summary

A 3-step day trading setup based on market structure, trend identification, and fair value gaps (FVG).

### Key Concepts

1. **Swing Points**
   - Swing High: A peak where price made a local high before reversing down
   - Swing Low: A trough where price made a local low before reversing up
   - Foundation for identifying BOS and CHoCH

2. **Trend Identification**
   - Look for 2+ contact points on a level (support/resistance)
   - Need 2+ breaks of structure (BOS) to confirm trend
   - Lower lows + lower highs = downtrend
   - Higher highs + higher lows = uptrend
   - Supply outweighs demand at resistance (drives price down)
   - Demand outweighs supply at support (drives price up)

3. **Break of Structure (BOS)**
   - Candle closes beyond a previous swing point in trend direction
   - Bullish BOS: Close above previous swing high
   - Bearish BOS: Close below previous swing low
   - Need 2+ BOS to confirm a trend

4. **Change of Character (CHoCH)**
   - When price fails to make a new low/high AND breaks the opposite direction
   - Signals potential trend reversal
   - Must be confirmed with a Fair Value Gap
   - Example: In downtrend, price fails to make lower low, then breaks above contact point

5. **Fair Value Gap (FVG)**
   - 3-candle sequence where candle 1's wick doesn't overlap with candle 3's wick
   - Bullish FVG: high[2] < low[0] (gap up)
   - Bearish FVG: low[2] > high[0] (gap down)
   - The gap between them is the FVG zone
   - 50% level = "Consequential Encroachment" (key entry zone)

6. **Displacement Candle**
   - The strong momentum candle that creates the FVG
   - Pushes price out of the trend level with force
   - Indicates true strength and conviction in the move

7. **FVG Invalidation Rule**
   - If FVG fills immediately on the next candle, setup is INVALID
   - Not indicating true strength - don't take the trade
   - FVG must hold to show genuine imbalance

### The 3-Step Setup

**Step 1:** Identify trend (2+ contact points, 2+ BOS)

**Step 2:** Wait for CHoCH + FVG formation

**Step 3:** Position entry at 50% of FVG
- Stop loss: Below swing point or FVG-producing candle
- Initial target: 4x risk
- Move to break-even after first BOS in new direction

### Take Profit Strategy

- Use higher timeframe FVGs as targets (e.g., 15m when trading 1/3/5m)
- Fibonacci retracement levels from trend high to low:
  - 23.6%
  - 38.2%
  - 50%
  - **61.8%** (golden ratio - most important)
  - 78.6%
- Look for confluence: HTF FVG + 61.8% Fib = strong target zone
- Trail stop loss using FVGs on runners (can achieve 6-7x R:R)

### Higher Timeframe Usage

- Entry timeframe: 1m, 3m, or 5m charts
- Take-profit analysis: 15m chart
- Look for "high impact" FVGs on higher timeframe as reversal zones

### Mindset Notes

- "Perfect setup" doesn't mean guaranteed win
- Good trade = following rules (not P&L)
- Don't attach more conviction/emotion to "better" setups
- C setups can run, A+ setups can lose
- Focus on contained risk, let edge play out over time
- Money is a byproduct of good trading, not the goal
