In this video, I will show you probably
0:01
the best trading indicator out there.
0:03
And it's not one of those technical
0:05
indicator like RSI, MACD, blah blah
0:07
blah. It's literally the money
0:09
indicator. And this indicator is called
0:10
the volume profile. And it's actually
0:12
showing you where most money in the
0:15
market was traded. A lot most retail
0:17
traders use normal candlestick and price
0:19
action concepts like higher highs,
0:20
higher lows, support and resistance, and
0:22
the classic stuff you find on the online
0:24
retail trading space. But in the
0:25
professional worlds, in hedge funds, in
0:27
the floor of world champions, they use
0:29
these type of indicators. And for good
0:31
reason, because if you use this
0:32
indicator correctly, and we're going to
0:34
learn how in this video, it can allow
0:35
you to truly follow the smart money on
0:38
the charts. And what are the actual
0:39
areas where they pour in a lot of money
0:42
that eventually moves price action. So
0:44
for all of those who are kind of not
0:46
into indicators, price action is more of
0:48
an indicator than volume. Volume is what
0:51
drives price. So you could consider it
0:53
some sort of leading indicators towards
0:55
price. In this video, I'm going to teach
0:56
you all the basics on what the volume
0:58
profile is and how to use it in a very
1:00
simple way to apply it right away in
1:02
your trading and see some radical
1:04
improvement in the way you open your
1:06
trades, you find areas and your overall
1:08
trading performance. So let's get
1:10
started. So this is how a volume profile
1:12
looks like. It basically show you at
1:14
every level of price how much volume of
1:17
transactions happened in the
1:19
marketplace. And we define a transaction
1:21
simply as a buyer being matched with a
1:23
seller. Okay. So volume profile shows
1:25
you the distribution of trading activity
1:28
inside of a session. For example, this
1:31
is a daily volume profile. You could use
1:33
a weekly volume profile. You can use a
1:35
one minute volume profile. So you can
1:37
see the distribution of trades inside of
1:39
any time frame you want. And what you
1:41
will notice is there's going to be a lot
1:43
of areas with big volume and a lot of
1:46
volume and areas with lower volume. And
1:48
this is the main thing we want to take a
1:50
look at high volume areas and low volume
1:52
areas. So you you have areas with high
1:54
distributions of volume and areas with
1:57
small distributions of volume which
1:59
means that a lot of trading happened in
2:01
these areas and less trading happened in
2:03
these areas. Then these levels where
2:05
there's a lot of volume specifically in
2:08
a few levels of price we call these high
2:12
volume nodes or HVN. the areas where
2:15
there's a little less volume and you
2:17
have these valleys compared to these
2:19
peaks in volume. These valleys we call
2:21
them low volume nodes. High volume node,
2:24
a high volume node, a low volume node.
2:26
This is another low volume node. This is
2:28
a high volume node. This is a low volume
2:29
node. Another low volume node. This is a
2:31
big high volume node. High volume node.
2:33
This is clearly a valley because you see
2:36
volume decreasing. So this is a low
2:37
volume node. This is a high volume node
2:39
again. Another one over here. Another
2:40
one over here. And then you have
2:42
ultimately the lower in the lower area
2:44
another low volume node. So this simply
2:47
means there was a lot of trading over
2:48
here. There was a lot of trades taken
2:50
also by big institutions and there was a
2:53
lot of exchange of contracts a lot of
2:56
trading activity from both sides of the
2:59
market from the buying side and from the
3:01
selling side. When you see low volume
3:03
nodes instead, this basically means that
3:05
there was few trades happening there,
3:07
right? You didn't have a lot of buying
3:09
pressure and a lot of selling pressure.
3:11
Typically, what you have in the low
3:12
volume nodes is one side of the market
3:15
is exerting a much harder pressure on
3:18
the overall auction on the overall price
3:20
compared to the other one. So low volume
3:22
node are let's say the more directional
3:25
sprints of the markets. So if you have
3:27
to kind of visualize it on a price
3:29
action level, this type of volume
3:31
distribution where you have low volume
3:33
here and then a lot of volume here, a
3:34
lot of volume here will probably
3:36
something like this. Price going down
3:38
really fast, especially here, right? Not
3:40
a lot of retracements going on. And then
3:42
when we start having this big volume
3:44
areas, you'll see price spending a lot
3:46
of time there, right? Cuz when a lot of
3:48
time is spent, a lot of time is being
3:50
spent there trading, exchanging a lot of
3:52
contracts and stocks and cryptos,
3:54
whatever it is. Then you have a slightly
3:55
lower volume here. So you're probably
3:57
going to have a phase of expansion
3:58
typically and then a lot of volume in
4:00
this area. So a lot of time spent here
4:02
as well. So all throughout this area,
4:04
you'll typically have a lot of price
4:06
action. And instead, you're not going to
4:08
have a lot of price action having gone
4:10
on on the lower area where there's lower
4:12
volume. So typically you're going to see
4:14
both. You're going to see when there's a
4:16
lot of volume, there's typically a lot
4:17
of price action. When there's low
4:19
volume, there's less price action. So
4:22
how much time is spent on a specific
4:25
range typically determines also how much
4:27
volume is traded at that specific uh
4:29
range of price. And as you can see we
4:31
have this different coloring between
4:33
this gray area and this yellow area.
4:36
Well, this differentiation is based on a
4:38
statistical concept called the normal
4:40
distribution or the Gaussian
4:42
distribution which is something of you
4:44
guys might have learned at school, some
4:45
of you might have not. But put it in
4:46
very simple terms when you analyze a
4:48
sample of data typically throughout
4:51
several observable phenomenons and let's
4:52
say these are some numbers that you can
4:54
quantify somehow they will tend to fall
4:56
under this type of shape this type of
4:58
bell. The classic example I make is with
5:01
the length of penises. So the
5:02
distribution of a population's penile
5:05
length will also fall under a very
5:07
similar curve where on this axis you
5:10
have penises of the length of 6 cm 7 8 9
5:13
10 blah blah blah up to 18. So for
5:16
example, you're going to have very a
5:17
very low amount of people with a penis
5:19
shorter than 10 cm. Very few people with
5:22
a penis above 15 cm and most of the
5:25
people being in the average range
5:27
between 11 and 14 or in the distribution
5:30
of height of males in a population. You
5:33
can see there's a lot you can see most
5:35
of the people are going to fall under a
5:37
height between 160 cm to 175
5:41
approximately. very few people are going
5:43
to be in the lower percentiles. So in
5:46
the very short people and very few
5:49
people will be in the highest
5:50
percentiles where people are really
5:52
really tall and going to the 6'4
5:54
heights. So the same concept can be
5:56
applied with volume where you have a lot
5:59
of volume traded at these prices less
6:02
and less volume traded at upper prices
6:05
less and less volume traded at lower
6:07
prices. So the normal distribution of
6:10
volume in this specific sample falls
6:13
under this range of price. So
6:15
statistically speaking everything that
6:17
falls under this range is considered
6:19
normal. Anything that happens outside in
6:22
the outer percentiles of our statistical
6:24
distribution is to be considered
6:26
somewhat an anomaly. Just like a super
6:28
tall guy or a super short guy are
6:31
anomalies. trading activity happen at
6:33
upper prices and or at lower prices
6:36
compared to this distribution is to be
6:38
considered some form of a statistical
6:40
anomaly inside of that session. And so
6:41
what we'll typically see is 68%
6:45
of the samples that we take into
6:47
considerations 68% will fall under one
6:50
standard deviation. Okay, this is a
6:53
negative and a positive standard
6:55
deviation. 95% of the samples will fall
6:58
under the second standard deviation.
7:00
negative standard deviation and positive
7:02
standard deviation and 99.7%
7:05
of samples will fall under the third
7:07
standard deviation either negative or
7:09
positive. So what we typically plot
7:11
inside of a volume profile distribution
7:13
is the first standard deviation only. So
7:16
where 68%
7:18
more or less we typically round it up to
7:20
70%. This is where 70% of the volume was
7:24
traded throughout that session. So let's
7:25
imagine a profile where this is the
7:27
current distribution and this is the
7:29
standard deviation. Well, it means that
7:31
most of the money was traded inside of
7:34
this area. So, anything that happens
7:35
outside is to be considered an anomaly
7:38
that could revert back to the mean. So,
7:40
whenever, for example, we are inside of
7:43
a volume range. One of the very common
7:45
type of trading that we can look for is
7:47
reversal trading and rangebound trading
7:50
setups where we basically sell the tops
7:52
and buy the bottoms whenever we go
7:54
outside of the first volume standard
7:56
deviation because we both have the
7:58
statistical reference of anything that
8:01
happens out is an anomaly statistically
8:03
speaking. But aside from statistics
8:05
alone, we also know that compared to the
8:08
distribution, these are cheap prices
8:11
where smart money could buy. And these
8:13
are premium prices where smart money
8:15
would prefer to sell, where it's more
8:16
likely to see aggressive sell activity
8:19
or aggressive buy activity pushing the
8:21
auction back in a situation of balance
8:24
and maybe target the highest volume
8:27
areas as a very probable target or the
8:30
other side of the distribution. So, for
8:32
example, when we see a breakout that
8:34
fails, we call this a failed auction. We
8:37
might, for example, want to buy here
8:38
with a stop-loss below here, targeting
8:40
either the other side as a take-profit,
8:43
or if you want to be more conservative,
8:45
targeting the point of control or the
8:47
highest volume node inside of the
8:49
distribution as a take-profit. And these
8:51
are all trading setups that can have a
8:53
very decent win rate with typically a
8:55
high risk-to-reward ratio. Another way
8:57
you can trade these is trend following.
8:59
So let's say before there was a
9:01
distribution of price here that created
9:03
a lot of volume. Okay. Whenever you see
9:05
a new distribution of price happening
9:08
above the previous one and a big chunk
9:11
of volume being traded at higher prices
9:14
than the previous biggest chunk of
9:15
volume. That's when you can qualify that
9:17
we're in an actual trend. Not just using
9:19
price action like this, okay? With highs
9:21
and lows that can be momentarily
9:23
breaking out but then breaking back in
9:25
and then creating, you know, all of
9:27
these fake outs. Well, just take a look
9:28
at where the total distribution is.
9:31
these anomalies and let's trade it when
9:33
we have a serious breakout, right? And
9:35
we see volume breaking out, not just the
9:38
high, but the whole range moving up
9:40
because that's where the money is.
9:42
That's where most of the money is being
9:43
traded. So, we want to follow the money.
9:45
So whenever this happens, you can either
9:47
buy over here to have even a higher
9:49
risk-to-reward or wait for a very strong
9:52
breakout that spends some time outside,
9:55
enter on the test, stop-loss under the
9:57
main high volume node, and that's also a
9:59
very high win rate, high risk-to-reward
10:01
type of setup. So this is all the basics
10:02
on what it is and already a little hints
10:05
on how to use it. But of course, you're
10:07
going to ask yourself, where how do I
10:09
get this type of indicator? Where can I
10:10
find it? And the truth is, you can find
10:12
some free versions of this online. So,
10:14
one option you have is to go for Trading
10:16
View's volume profile indicator. So, you
10:18
look for volume profile and you have the
10:19
session volume profile, which is
10:21
something you need to pay for, by the
10:23
way. It's not included in the free
10:25
version of it. And you're going to get a
10:26
first level of volume profile. Let's go
10:28
on the future contract. And yes, as you
10:31
can see, we have a daily version of the
10:33
volume profile. But the problem with
10:35
these volume profiles is they're a
10:37
little bit weird. They're not based on
10:39
actual trading data. They're based on
10:41
something called tick volume, which is a
10:42
very rough approximation of actual
10:45
trading volume. Plus, they are grouped
10:47
in a weird way that personally I don't
10:49
really like. You can kind of customize
10:51
it, I think, with the row size and stuff
10:53
like that. But the problem with these
10:55
type of volume profile is they're a
10:57
proxy of real volume. You could use
10:59
them. I personally don't because for my
11:01
trading, I want to access real data. And
11:03
if I have to pay for it, I might as well
11:05
just go for the real deal, which is for
11:07
example what we have on deep charts. And
11:08
on deep charts, if you open a new price
11:11
chart and select, for example, the S&P
11:13
500 or anything else here, you not only
11:15
get a normal price action chart, but you
11:17
also get real volume from the CME
11:20
exchange, which requires more powerful
11:22
computational data this platform
11:24
provides, which is also why it's a
11:26
desktop type of platform because this
11:27
data is processed mostly by your GPU or
11:30
CPU. So, I can right click on my chart,
11:32
go on indicators, and search for deep
11:35
profile. And I have a lot of them. I
11:37
will just add the deep profile and you
11:39
can start seeing it now on the screens
11:41
and this is going to be based on the
11:43
actual volume from the exchange. So
11:45
let's kind of compare it to the normal
11:48
type of volume profile and see if there
11:50
is any difference. Let's put this one
11:51
here and let's put this other one over
11:52
here. We have to connect to the data
11:54
feed. So it loads the rest of the last
11:56
few days of data. Now let's compare this
11:58
session as an example in this type of
12:00
tick database volume chart where a
12:02
volume is considered such where you had
12:05
at least one tick up or one tick down
12:07
and that constitutes one volume but for
12:10
every tick up or every tick down there
12:12
could be countless contracts being
12:14
traded. So it's a proxy again. So it's
12:16
not going to be as precise as this. And
12:18
as you can see if the point of control
12:20
of this distribution is now here around
12:23
the prices of $69.99
12:26
here the point of control is at 69.87 so
12:29
several points below. So you don't have
12:31
the same level of reliability and the
12:34
the level of details that allow you to
12:36
take truly informed trading decision
12:38
because again this is a proxy which
12:40
approximately gives you the same value
12:43
area. Okay, like this is pretty decently
12:45
similar. Uh even though even here you
12:47
can see that this volume area ends here,
12:49
but the actual value area here ends up
12:52
below all of these lows. So slightly
12:54
below. As you can see, there's some
12:56
considerable differences here that makes
12:58
me if I want to pay even around the same
13:00
price, I'm going to go with the real
13:02
deal. I'm going to go with the actual
13:03
volume profile. And so on these
13:04
situations, for example, we can see that
13:06
the last distribution of volume was
13:08
here. So this is the previous session
13:10
volume profile, right? And so this is
13:13
what we can consider the first standard
13:15
deviation, right? And what volume
13:16
traders typically will do is they will
13:18
consider the area around the 70% the
13:22
upper limit of the first standard
13:24
deviation and the area around the lower
13:26
standard deviation as an overall area of
13:29
support and resistance as we discussed
13:31
before. And around all of this area is
13:33
where you had a lot of trades trying to
13:35
break out and revert back to the mean.
13:37
Bounce from the downside, bounce from
13:38
the upside all the way to the mean. And
13:40
this is the first time where instead we
13:42
had some volume over here which is
13:44
probably going to lead to a breakout at
13:46
this point. But let's see. We don't
13:47
know. It's still the London session. And
13:49
another reason why I would use for
13:50
example a deep charts volume profile is
13:52
that you can go down here in the daily
13:53
volume profile. Go to the settings and
13:55
set it not only with volume but with
13:57
volume and delta which is a very
14:00
interesting type of data. So instead of
14:02
just having a normal profile, this
14:03
profile shows you the delta of volume at
14:07
each level. So you have to know that the
14:09
way volume is calculated is the normal
14:11
volume is total buying pressure and
14:15
total selling pressure. Delta tells you
14:17
the total buying pressure minus the
14:20
total selling pressure. So you have the
14:22
net level of pressure at each level of
14:25
price. This is what we call a delta
14:28
profile. So it's not just a volume
14:29
profile. That's why it's called the deep
14:32
profile, right? It's in the name. It's
14:34
the deep profile. It's the deeper level
14:36
of information than just volume. And you
14:38
can see that here there was a a big sell
14:40
order at the very top right over here
14:43
that brought price back into a situation
14:45
of balance, right? And then you clearly
14:48
saw a very big cluster of aggressive
14:51
buying happening all the way at this
14:54
level of prices. And that's exactly
14:55
where buyers step in again in the rest
14:58
of the session and pump all this way up.
15:00
This is something that you probably have
15:01
seen. Fabio Valentini, one of the best
15:03
scalpers uh out there, use a lot this
15:06
delta profile where you can also clearly
15:09
see from the previous session where was
15:11
the area with most selling. Well, it's
15:13
clearly this one. There's no doubt about
15:15
it. It's numbers, right? So, all of this
15:17
area we can extend it. Let me put a
15:18
little bit of a background. And this is
15:20
where the battle happens a lot of time.
15:22
This is where sellers take control of
15:24
the auction over and over and over again
15:26
multiple times and again here a lot a
15:29
lot a lot of times. And another
15:30
information that the deep profile gives
15:32
us is this yellow line here which is the
15:35
volume weighted average price which is
15:37
also known as the VWAP. And the VWAP is
15:40
simply the average price of the entire
15:43
session weighted by volume which is this
15:45
one over here. We can set it up and we
15:46
can also have the developing VWAP which
15:48
a lot a lot a lot of traders love to use
15:51
especially institutional traders because
15:52
it's the most common reference points to
15:55
you know it's one of the most common
15:57
levels or mathematical formulas used in
16:00
the institutional space for best feeling
16:02
algorithms best execution algorithms and
16:05
stuff like that and another very
16:06
interesting thing that we can do is we
16:08
can go down all the way to filter split
16:11
time and have it split it RTH which
16:13
basically mean it's going to split the
16:15
profile in two different profiles. One
16:17
being the cash session or the regular
16:20
trading hours, the stock market session
16:22
and the other one being the Asian
16:23
session and the London session. So for
16:26
example, I can also have between the
16:28
indicators I can search for volume which
16:30
is the classic volume indicators that
16:32
you know shows you volume by time
16:34
instead of volume by price. And you can
16:36
clearly see you know the regular trading
16:38
hours are the hours where most volume is
16:40
traded. So you might want to have only
16:43
the volume profile for the so-called
16:45
cash session, the regular trading hours,
16:47
because that's where most money is
16:48
traded anyways. And consider these
16:50
areas, so the areas, the value areas of
16:53
the volume profile of the cash session
16:55
instead of the entirety of the session.
16:58
And you'll see that those are the areas
17:00
that responds best for price action
17:02
ideas, for breakout ideas. So this is
17:04
how I personally like to keep my volume
17:06
profile looking. So to summarize a way
17:08
we can use this for example is the first
17:11
use case would be to see approximately
17:14
roughly where these volume profiles are
17:16
going right and whenever we see a shift
17:19
in volume it's not just a shift in
17:21
market structure it's a shift in where
17:23
the real flow of money is going which is
17:26
a much more statistically significant
17:28
indication than simply highs or lows
17:31
that can be widely random at times. So
17:34
as we like to see bulks of price action,
17:36
we want to see bulks of volume because
17:39
that's where the money is going. So
17:40
instead of just using the classic market
17:43
structure, we can use volume market
17:45
structure, also known as the auction
17:46
market theory model. So the first way is
17:48
to determine a bias. So we know the
17:51
trend is up if we see volume going up,
17:53
if we see the money going up. The second
17:55
way we can use this is to qualify
17:57
support and resistance quote unquote or
17:59
supply and demand areas where if we
18:01
already know that we're in an uptrend,
18:04
this is the previous session value area,
18:05
the point of control. We know that for
18:07
example, if we want to look for buy
18:08
opportunities, we might wait for around
18:11
this area, the lower part of our
18:13
distribution. We want to see price
18:14
failing below and then entering our
18:17
trade together with a trend and maybe
18:18
target the other side of the value area.
18:21
Or if we spend some more time inside
18:22
here, but then we break out and spend
18:24
some times inside, then opt for a
18:27
breakout type of trade. So the first is
18:29
bias. The second use case is as a
18:32
support and resistance area. And lastly,
18:34
we could also use it as a trigger, which
18:37
is the final use case that I will show
18:38
you today. And I'm just going to go on
18:40
templates in the full version. I'm going
18:42
to select Andrachimi ES 5 minutes. And
18:45
this is a template that you can find
18:47
inside of deep charts where you can
18:49
simply already have the split volume
18:50
profile for each session, the cash
18:52
session and the London plus Asian
18:54
session, the extended trading hour
18:56
session or electronic trading hour
18:57
session. A composite volume profile that
18:59
tells you the entirety of the volume
19:02
distribution of the chart you have that
19:04
I typically like to go on up over here
19:07
price settings and maybe I want to load
19:09
for example I don't know 90 days of
19:12
price. I'm going to apply it save. It's
19:14
going to build a chart because there's a
19:15
lot of data that needs to be processed.
19:16
There you go. And now I have 90 days
19:19
worth of market data and I have a very
19:21
beautiful overall profile distribution
19:24
of the current volume. So I can use this
19:26
as a long-term bias. Then I can use
19:28
sessions, the daily sessions as my
19:30
intraday bias. Plus, and finally, I can
19:33
use the volume profile of each and every
19:37
single one of the candles. As you can
19:39
see, the more I zoom in, the more I can
19:40
see there's a volume profile in each
19:42
candle. And I can see through order
19:44
flows, so through shortterm volume
19:46
trading activity, if there's absorptions
19:49
or if there's initiative phases. For
19:51
example, I can see from the volume
19:53
profile distribution of this candle,
19:54
there was a lot of buying happening over
19:58
here. Let's zoom in and see it with our
20:00
own eyes. Make the text a little bigger.
20:02
Yep. And as you can see, a sell candle
20:04
happened here, which means sellers took
20:06
control of the auction. And here I can
20:08
see that there is something happening
20:10
over here that most price action traders
20:13
won't be able to see which is there is a
20:15
buyer here which was trying to buy this
20:18
market but a huge seller blocked his way
20:20
up. So there was a huge chunk of volume
20:23
over here that shifted from being up
20:25
here. So the first distribution was over
20:28
here. This is where this was the main
20:30
let's say value area and now the value
20:32
is shifted and we have a lot of volume
20:34
traded over here. So, we not only have
20:36
an engulfing type of pattern where you
20:38
have one candle being bigger than the
20:40
previous one, but we can also have an
20:41
extra confirmation with volume that
20:43
allows us to have a even deeper edge to
20:45
understand who's really in control. And
20:47
after that candle, you see price melting
20:49
down right after we've failed to break
20:52
out the main value area of the daily
20:54
distribution. And so when you see a
20:56
pattern like this and when you see such
20:58
a shift in volume in the shortterm time
21:00
frames as a confirmation of your main
21:03
idea in the higher time frames which is
21:05
the one we talked about before where we
21:06
have a statistical anomalies in this
21:08
session and we might as well fade it
21:10
back to the mean. That's our trigger
21:12
with a stop above here and trading all
21:15
the way until here. Or another example
21:16
here of the opposite type of setup where
21:18
we have yes a distribution of volume
21:21
around this area. So this is our current
21:23
value area and in the following session
21:25
what happens is and of course we only
21:27
take a look at this cash session forget
21:29
about the London session for a second
21:30
and consider this cash session instead
21:33
even though as you can see these areas
21:34
are pretty much working all the way also
21:36
in the London session multiple times.
21:38
What happens here is we start the
21:40
session on the lower side. We go we
21:43
shoot all the way up to the other side
21:45
of the range. We fail to auction above.
21:47
We drop back inside reverse back to the
21:49
mean. But then we break out again. And
21:51
when we break out again, it means we're
21:53
starting to spend a long time there. And
21:55
for example, this is the opening range.
21:56
And when we break out of the opening
21:58
range, we can buy this market with a
22:00
very conservative stop-loss right below
22:02
here and basically take this entire
22:04
session for a 1:3 risk-to-reward ratio
22:07
with a really, really high win rate.
22:08
when we have a qualified breakout
22:10
outside. So you can either again fade
22:13
the bottoms and the tops of the volume
22:15
profiles of the first standard deviation
22:17
of volume or trade the breakouts when
22:19
you have serious confirmation that we're
22:22
actually moving out of the current area
22:24
of fair value. And these my friends are
22:26
some very easy examples on how to use
22:27
the volume profile. And by the way a lot
22:29
of people ask me how about the point of
22:31
control? How should we use the point of
22:32
control? Should we enter on the point of
22:34
control? I would not look at the point
22:36
of control as a singular level because
22:38
that can be random at times. I prefer to
22:40
look at distribution of volume. That has
22:42
much more meaning than how much volume
22:44
was traded in a single level. Cuz look
22:46
at this. Yeah, this is the point of
22:47
control. This is the level where most
22:48
money was traded. But look at the
22:49
following one. It's basically the same
22:51
amount of volume. This one is basically
22:52
the same amount of volume. This one is
22:54
the same amount of volume. There's not a
22:55
huge difference. It's just maybe also
22:57
randomly. This is the main point of
22:59
control, but who cares? Like this is the
23:01
high volume node. It's more important to
23:03
find a high volume node than the actual
23:05
precise point of control because again
23:07
as we said that can be due to
23:09
algorithmic activity that was not meant
23:11
to be at that specific level but more in
23:13
an area of price. Okay. And as of now
23:15
you've just seen me you know show you
23:17
past stuff. Okay. So another thing that
23:19
people might say is yes in hindsight
23:21
everyone's good to cherry pick a couple
23:23
example and I totally get that. I need
23:26
to do that to show some examples. If you
23:28
