### Price Action Fundamentals

## Candlestick Anatomy

**Definition:** A candlestick is a visual representation of price movement within a single time period, displaying four key prices (Open, High, Low, Close) through a body and wicks.

**Characteristics:**
- **Body:** Thick rectangular portion showing the range between Open and Close
- **Wicks (Shadows):** Thin lines extending above and below the body, showing High and Low
- **Bullish candle (green):** Close is ABOVE Open — price moved up during the period
- **Bearish candle (red):** Close is BELOW Open — price moved down during the period

**Identification Criteria:**
1. Bullish candle: Open at bottom of body, Close at top of body
2. Bearish candle: Open at top of body, Close at bottom of body
3. Upper wick extends from body top to the High price
4. Lower wick extends from body bottom to the Low price

**Context:** Universal structure for all candlesticks across all timeframes and assets.

**Trading Implication:** Body size indicates conviction (large = strong directional move); wick length indicates rejection (long wick = price rejected at that level).

## Candlestick Strength (Body Size)

**Definition:** The size of a candlestick's body relative to its total range indicates the strength of buying or selling pressure—larger bodies signal stronger conviction, smaller bodies signal indecision.

**Characteristics:**
- **Very bullish:** Large body (70%+ of range), small wicks — buyers dominated
- **Less bullish:** Smaller body, longer wicks — buyers won but faced resistance
- **Neutral (Doji):** Tiny or no body — neither side won; indecision
- **Less bearish:** Smaller body, longer wicks — sellers won but faced resistance
- **Very bearish:** Large body (70%+ of range), small wicks — sellers dominated
- **Important:** A candle only shows Open, High, Low, Close — NOT the path price took during that period

**Identification Criteria:**
1. Calculate body size as percentage of total candle range (high minus low)
2. Body ≥ 70% of range → strong conviction in that direction
3. Body ≤ 30% of range → weak conviction / indecision
4. Body ≈ 0% (open equals close) → Doji, complete indecision

**Context:** Applies to every candlestick; used to gauge momentum and filter signal quality. When comparing candles with the same High and Low, only the body determines relative bullishness or bearishness.

**Trading Implication:** Large-bodied candles suggest continuation; small-bodied candles suggest potential reversal or consolidation. Wicks can reverse implied strength — a bearish body with a long lower wick may actually be bullish because bulls recovered before close.

## Candlestick Wick Analysis

**Definition:** Wick analysis compares wick lengths between candles with similar bodies to determine which candle represents stronger bullish or bearish conviction — longer wicks indicate greater price rejection and stronger directional pressure.

**Characteristics:**
- Two candles with identical Open, Close, and one High/Low can have different strength based on wick length alone
- Longer wick = more price traveled = stronger move required to create that rejection
- Bullish candle with longer lower wick is MORE bullish (bulls overcame a deeper push down)
- Bearish candle with longer upper wick is MORE bearish (bears overcame a stronger push up)

**Identification Criteria:**
1. Compare candles where Open, Close, and one extreme (High or Low) are at the same level
2. The candle with the longer wick in the opposite direction of the body shows stronger conviction
3. For bullish candles: longer lower wick = stronger bullish rejection
4. For bearish candles: longer upper wick = stronger bearish rejection

**Context:** Especially significant at support/resistance levels. A wick that pierces through a key level and then reverses signals strong rejection — buying pressure at support, selling pressure at resistance.

**Trading Implication:** Candles that look similar at first glance can tell very different stories. A long wick through support that closes back above confirms buyers stepped in; a long wick through resistance that closes back below confirms sellers defended the level.

## Candlestick Momentum

**Definition:** Candlestick momentum measures the speed/velocity of price movement by comparing body sizes of consecutive candles — shrinking bodies indicate weakening momentum, while a candle at least 2x larger than previous candles is a "momentum candle" signaling strong directional conviction.

**Characteristics:**
- Momentum = speed/velocity of price movement relative to previous candles
- Body size is the primary indicator: longer body = stronger momentum
- Decreasing body sizes across consecutive candles = momentum is weakening
- Small body + long wicks = uncertainty/indecision (neither bulls nor bears in control)
- **Momentum Candle:** A candle with body at least 2x larger than the previous 3 candles (3-5x is even stronger)

**Identification Criteria:**
1. Compare real body sizes of consecutive candles in a trend
2. Shrinking bodies = momentum decreasing (potential reversal or consolidation ahead)
3. Body ≥ 2x the size of previous 3 candles = momentum candle
4. The larger the ratio (3x, 4x, 5x), the stronger the momentum signal

**Context:** Applies to any trending market. Decreasing momentum often precedes consolidation or reversal. Momentum candles appear at trend reversals or continuation breakouts.

**Trading Implication:** Use shrinking bodies as early warning that a trend may be losing steam. Momentum candles provide strong entry/exit signals — a momentum candle in the opposite direction of the trend suggests reversal; in the same direction suggests continuation.

## Candlestick Pattern Classification

**Definition:** Every candlestick pattern has three classifications — Complexity (number of candles), Direction (expected price movement), and Type (reversal or continuation) — that together define how to identify and trade the pattern.

**Characteristics:**
- **Complexity:**
  - Simple = 1 candle (e.g., Hammer, Doji, Shooting Star, Hanging Man)
  - Complex = 2+ candles (e.g., Engulfing, Morning Star, Three White Soldiers)
- **Direction:**
  - Bullish = expects price to move UP after pattern completes
  - Bearish = expects price to move DOWN after pattern completes
  - Neutral = direction unknown, but context can provide bias
- **Type:**
  - Reversal = pattern signals trend direction will reverse
  - Continuation = pattern signals trend direction will continue

**Identification Criteria:**
1. Count the candles in the pattern → Simple (1) or Complex (2+)
2. Determine expected price direction → Bullish, Bearish, or Neutral
3. Assess relationship to prior trend → Reversal (opposite direction) or Continuation (same direction)
4. Context is critical — a pattern appearing randomly means little; location on chart matters

**Context:** Applies to ALL candlestick patterns. Neutral patterns can become directional with proper context (e.g., Doji after downtrend at support = bullish bias). Four main directional combinations exist: Bullish Reversal, Bearish Reversal, Bullish Continuation, Bearish Continuation.

**Trading Implication:** Before trading any pattern, identify its classification to know what to expect. Reversal patterns require a preceding trend to reverse; continuation patterns require a preceding trend to continue.
