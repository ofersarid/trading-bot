in this ultimate video course you will learn everything you need to know about Candlestick patterns for trading stocks
Forex crypto or any other Financial Market by watching the full course you
will not only be able to trade Candlestick patterns like a pro but you will also gain the edge to profit in
both Bull and bar markets so hello guys and welcome to
What you will Learn in this Course
this Candlestick pattern trading course this right here is going to be a pretty long video so make sure to you know grab
a pen and paper perhaps grab a coffee as well and without further Ado let's get
started here and let's begin here by super quickly taking a look at what you can expect to learn from this course we
will start this course off by taking a look at both how to read but also how to
understand candlesticks and Candlestick patterns we will take a look at the very Basics but we will also look at Concepts
like Candlestick strength Candlestick momentum we will take a look at Wicks and much more after chapter one
when we have a good understanding of the basics it's time for chapter 2 and in this chapter we will take a look at
Candlestick pattern classifications in order to master Candlestick patterns it's of course very important to
understand you know what type of Candlestick patterns you are trading what types do you want to focus on what
types do you want to avoid and so on and so on so chapter 2 here is very important and this will be a quick
chapter um because every single candas pattern has three different categories
every pattern has a complexity level every pattern has a direction and a type
and as I said don't worry if this sounds a little bit complicated right now it will be clear very very soon in chapter
3 we are going to take a look at the best reversal Candlestick patterns and
we will not only look at the patterns but we will also take a look at trading strategies for every single Candlestick
pattern and reversal Candlestick patterns are one of the most effective Candlestick types and if you learn all
of these patterns and even more importantly if you also learn about the trading strategies for these patterns
I'm sure you will become a much better Trader and for example if you take a look at this image right here in the
upper right corner this right here is an example of a reversal Candlestick pattern and we will take a look at that
exact pattern and how to trade it later on in this video and so much more uh but
now in chapter 4 it's time to take a look at the best continuation
Candlestick patterns and we will of course also take a look at trading strategies for every single pattern
understanding continuation patterns is something you pretty much can't do without as a Trader and in chapter 4 I
will talk about multiple continuation patterns including one of my personal
favorite patterns of all time so make sure to stay tuned for that and last but
definitely not least we're going to take a look at the dogee and the spinning top
candles and these are a specific family of Candlestick patterns that is super
important uh to understand as a Trader these are patterns that happens all the time in the market and they can provide
significant signals uh both warning signs but also ENT signals that we as
Traders need to be able to utilize but all right guys let's get started here with chapter one all right so before we
How to Read Candlestick Charts (step-by-step)
start looking at all the Candlestick patterns and you know everything you need to know about the actual
candlesticks we of course have to start here with the basics and that is of
course how do we read candlesticks and how do we read Candlestick charts well
first things first we have two different types of candles we have a red candle which is also
called a bearish candle and we have a green candle which is also called a
bullish candle sometimes if you see a black and white chart it is the green
candle that is white and the Black Candle is red and the difference between these candles is that during the red
candle the price goes down and during the green candle the price goes up and
each candle can represent different time periods so one Candlestick can be for
example one day uh but one Candlestick can also represent for example 1 hour uh
I'm sorry for my ugly writing here but I hope you can see uh and one candle can for example represent one minute and
these different time periods right here is what we call time frames and when you are looking at the chart in for example
trading view you can choose what type of time frame you want to trade so for
example if you choose a daily time frame then every Candlestick on the chart will
represent one day but if you choose a for example one minute time frame then
every Candlestick you see on the chart will represent 1 minute and so on and so
on but to make this example simple we can think about every Candlestick right here as representing one day and now and
this is very important every single Candlestick has four different points we
have a high we have a open we have a close and we have a low and for the red
candle remember that during this candle the price Falls so the candle opens
right here or in other words if this is a daily candle the open price is the price level at the start of the day the
high right here is the highest point the price reached during the day so perhaps
the price opened right here it went up all the way up here to the high then the
next Point here is the low that is the lowest point the price reached during the day so as I said the price might
start right here it went up to the high but then during the day the price went down all the way down here to the lowest
point I hope you can see all the way down to the lowest point and then before the end of the day the price went up all
the way way here to the close so during that red candle the price might have
moved something like this right and when you understand the bearish Candlestick you will also very easily understand the
bullish Candlestick this is basically the exact same thing but the opposite so in this case the price opens or starts
all the way down here during the candle the price went down here to our lowest
point all the way down here and during the day the price went up all all the
way up here to a highest point all the way up here and before the day ended the
price came down here to the closing price so this right here is basically how you read the candlesticks uh but we
have a few important uh Concepts we also need to learn about the first concept is
what we call a wick or a shadow and you can see that we have these both at the
top or we can have them at the top and the bottom and the Wicks and the Shadows
are simply these small lines right here that are either above or below the
candles and these small points show us the highest and lowest point of the
period or in other words the time frame uh last but not least we have something
called the body uh this is also sometimes called the real body uh but in
very simple terms the body is the wide part here of the candles and remember
the wide parts of the candle determine the closing and the opening price and
one last thing here I just want to mention is that these names open high
low and close these points are for short called oh LC so if you ever stumble upon
something called ohlc you know that this means open high
low close and this is based on the candlesticks all right then so now when
Bullish and Bearish Candle Strength
we have a basic understanding of how to read candlesticks now we are ready to talk about something called bullish and
bearish strength and now I want you all to focus on this image right here and
the first thing I want you guys to notice about these candles is that for all of these candles the highest points
are at the exact same level right and we can also notice here that for all of these candles the lowest points so the
low here are also at the exact same Lev level so the only difference between all
of these candles is the body of the candles right and the bodies of the candles are very very important because
they are one of the most important factors they're actually one of two factors that determines how bullish or
bearish a Candlestick is so for example if we take a look at the Candlestick all the way to the to the left here we can
see that the candle opens all the way down here and during the candle it pushed up to the highest point all the
way up here so this basically represents a very strong movement here towards the upside but if you take a look at the
candle all the way to the right here you can see that the opposite is true it open all the way up here and during the
candle it pushed down all the way down here but now I want to talk about a very
important thing here and that is that even if we see a Candlestick that looks for example like this candle right here
this doesn't mean that the candle during the day fell in a straight line like
this it could have moved something like this remember it might have open all the way up here and then during the candle
it might have moved you know something like this something like a trend here towards the downside the only thing we
know for certain about this candle is that it opened here it closed here and
since we have no Wicks so we have no Wicks like this and like this we also know that the highest point during the
day was this point and the lowest point during the day was this point but now if
you take a look at for example this Candlestick right here instead we can still see that the highest point of the
candle and the lowest point of the candle is at the exact same level but
this candle right here tells us a very different story about the price because
during this candle it opened right here and then we fell we fell all the way
down here right but before the candle closed the Bulls manag to take control and
actually reverse the price all the way up to this point so while this candle right here is very bearish and shows
lots of bearish strength this candle this candle is actually much more
bullish and this candle is actually almost something we call a hammer and
that's actually a bullish reversal candle and we will talk more about the hammer and we will talk about a hammer
trading strategy later on in this video but for now all you need to know here is that this candle is much more bullish
but now let's actually focus on this candle right here you can see in this case we have a very very small body of
the candle uh but at the same time we have very long Wicks you can see we have
a long upper Wick and we have a long lower Wick so during this candle perhaps the price moved something like this it
started here during the candle we went all all the way up here uh during the candle we also fell all the way down
here right but before the candles to close we pretty much closed here at the
exact same place where the candles stick started so these kind of candles when we
have very small bodies and very long Wicks these candles are actually neutral
so they don't really show any bullish or any bearish strength what they basically show us is something called indecision
or in other words that neither the Bulls or the Bears are in control of the
market and this specific handle is actually something we call a dogee candle and I will talk more about dogee
candles and why they are so important later on in this course all right so now
Candlestick Wick Analysis
it's time to actually switch the attention here and take a look at something called candlestick Wick
analysis and as you can see here on the screen we have two different candles but
they are actually very similar if we look closely we can see that the high point here for all the candles are at
the exact same level we can also see that the candle opened at the exact same
price and the candles also closed at the exact same price so the only difference
between these two candles is that for the candle to the left here we had a low
Point all the way down here but for the Candlestick to the right right here we had a low Point down here and this
difference here between the low points are actually more important than you
might think so let's actually visualize these two candles so for the candle to the right uh we can imagine that the
price opened right here uh but then during the candle we can see that the price reached a point all the way all
the way down here and then it quickly pushed up all the way up to the highest
point and before the candle closed we closed all the way down here uh but if you take a look at the candle to the
right here we can see that it has a similar start but during the candle it went down to this point it went up to
this point and then it went down so here for the Candlestick to the right you can
see that the move we saw from the low to the high was much much longer compared
to the move we saw here to the right you can see this move was only this far
while the move to the left was much stronger and that means that this candle is actually more bullish compared to
this candle because we need more bullish strength to push the price from all the way down here up to this point compared
to the strength we need to push the price from this point to this point and when you look at the chart especially as
a beginner you might feel like these two candles are basically the same thing but
it is these sort of small differences like the Candlestick Wick right here
that can really make a difference and especially let's say that we for example
have a support area right here then these type of candles when the price
Wicks below and then quickly pushes above the support this becomes even more
important because this tells us that we actually found buying pressure coming in at the support level which is yet
another bullish sign and now let's really quickly here take a look at another example this one is pretty
similar as you can see we have the lowest point for both of these candles are at the
exact same level uh we have the open here at the exact same level and we also
have the close at the same level once again the difference between these two
candles is that to the right we had a very long upper Wick right or upper
Shadow and to the right here we have a very short uh upper shadow so now as an
exercise I want you guys to drop a comment down below and tell me which of these candles are the most barish feel
free to pause the video right now if you want to well the answer here is that the candle to the left is more bearish
because during this candle the price open here during the candle we pushed all the way up to this point but the
bars took full control here and managed to push the price all the way down to
this point while in the other candle we we had a much sort of uh weaker movement
this is still a bearish movement but the price moved something like this right
and you can see that this movement right here is much more bearish compared to this movement right here and once again
this becomes even more important if we for example have a resistance area right here because in this case the candle to
the left confirms that the resistance is holding all right so now the time has
The Power of Candlestick Momentum
come to take a look at one of the most important Concepts when it comes to
candlesticks and Candlestick patterns and that is Candlestick momentum analysis and first of all we need to of
course understand here what is momentum what does momentum mean when we talk about Candlestick patterns well in
simple terms we can think about momentum as the speed or velocity of price
movement or in other words we're talking about how sort of fast is the price
moving compared to the previous candles so in this example you can see that the
very first candle is a red one and it is a pretty strong red candle the next
candle here is you know getting a little bit weaker and we can see that because
the length of the real body of the candle is getting a bit smaller if we
take a look at the third candle right here we can see that the real body is even smaller here and we also have some
pretty long upper and lower wigs and you know from earlier in this course that
when we have small real bodies and long Wicks here this basically signals
uncertainty or in other words that neither the Bulls or the bars are in control and if we take a look at this
last candle right here you can see that the real body is pretty much non-existent we have a very small real
body the Candlestick opens and closes at the same level uh so this right here is
a dogee candle so for this downtrend right here we can see that the momentum is decreasing and if you want a simple
tip to determine the momentum of a candle I recommend to focus here on the
real bodies the longer the real body the stronger the momentum in general you
need to also consider the Wicks here it's also important but as a rule of thumb the longer real body we have the
stronger than momentum so by looking at the real bodies here we can see that the momentum is decreasing and now I want
you guys to learn a very important concept and that is something called
momentum candle and what is a momentum candle well different Traders have some
different definitions when it comes to momentum candles but I like to Define
momentum candles as a Candlestick that is at at least two times larger compared
to the previous candles so for example if we look at these three previous candles right here we can see that the
real body of the green candle right here is more than twice the size of the
previous candles so that's why I consider this right here as a momentum
candle and momentum candles are very important because they can provide strong signals when we trade and I will
talk more about momentum candles later on in this video but for now uh all you need to know is that momentum can be
determined by the real bodies of the candle and momentum candles in general
can be defined as a Candlestick that is at least two twice the size of the previous candle but preferably we want
to see a candle that is you know maybe three times as large or even you know five times sometimes it can be even five
times as large as the previous candles and then we are talking about a very
strong momentum candle all right so at this point in the course you already have a you know pretty good
Classification of Candlestick Patterns (Complexity, Direction, and Type)
understanding of how to read candlesticks you know about you know uh Wick analysis you know about momentum
and strength so now we are very soon ready to start taking a look at our Candlestick patterns and also our
Candlestick pattern trading strategies uh but real quick before we look look at that we need to learn about the
classification of Candlestick patterns so first of all all candisc patterns has
three different classifications the first classification is called complexity and a candles pattern can be
either simple or complex and a simple Candlestick pattern is a Candlestick
pattern that consist of only one candle so for example uh we have been talking
about earlier about dogee candles that look something like this this right here is an example of a simple Candlestick
pattern uh we also have a pattern that is called the hammer it looks something
like this the hammer is another example of a simple Candlestick pattern another
Candlestick pattern is the shooting star it looks something like this this is yet another example of a simple one but even
for simple Candlestick patterns like right here if you just see a Candlestick pattern appearing randomly on the chart
it doesn't actually mean a lot the context or in other words where on the
chart the patterns appear is very important and we will talk about that later on and a complex Candlestick
pattern is basically a Candlestick pattern that consists of two or more candlesticks sometimes it can be you
know even five or more candlesticks but an example of a complex pattern is the
barish engulfing pattern it looks something like this the first candle here is green the second candle here is
red this is an example of a bearish reversal pattern so before this pattern up here we have an uptrend this pattern
indicates then that the price will reverse to the downside so all patterns that are two or more Candlestick uh are
complex patterns so for example here on the image you can see that all of these Candlestick patterns are one candle
patterns so these are simple patterns and you can see that all of the two Candlestick patterns like all of these
all of these three plus Candlestick patterns all of these are complex but now the next uh classification is the
direction and here the direction can be either bullish bearish or neutral a
bullish pattern indicates that the price will go up after the pattern a bearish
pattern indicates that the price uh will go down after the pattern and a neutral pattern indicates that we don't really
know here if the price will go up or down after the pattern however depending on the context of the neutral pattern
these patterns can actually also tell us something about where the price will go
next so for example remember that the dogee is a neutral pattern but if we have before the dogee let's say that we
have a strong downtrend so this right here are red candles and then a doe pattern appears like this in this case
even though this right here is a neutral pattern it can actually indicate a reversal to the upside especially if we
have some sort of support right right here we perhaps have some sort of indicator that also confirms the bullish
bias the third classification we have right here is the type and here we have
reversal patterns and we have continuation patterns a reversal pattern
basically means that if we have a downtrend and then the pattern appears
so let's say that this is a random pattern then the goal of this pattern is to reverse the price so reverse the
price in the opposite direction C while a continuation pattern means that let's once again say that we have a downtrend
then the pattern appears the goal of a continuation pattern is to continue the price to the downside so for example
this pattern right here is a bullish reversal pattern because it indicates a
reversal to the upside and this right here is a bearish continuation pattern right
because it indicates a continuation of the trend to the downside and we also of
course have bearish reversal patterns and we also have bullish continuation
patterns so we basically have four different combinations all right so now we are finally ready to start taking a
Best Reversal Candlestick Patterns
look at Candlestick patterns and let's actually begin here by taking a look at the best reversal Candlestick patterns
and first of all what is a reversal pattern well reversal patterns indicates
a trend shift so either from bullish to bearish or from bearish to bullish so it
can reverse the price from down to up or from up to down and reversal patterns
can be either simple or complex and as you know simple patterns consist of one
Candlestick complex pattern consist of two or more and here and this is super
important the context for the patterns is very very important or in other words
where on the chart the patterns appear is crucial when it comes to reversal
patterns so with this three rules in mind now we are ready to take a look at our first pattern so the very first
The Bullish Engulfing Pattern
pattern we're going to take a look at is called the bullish engulfing pattern and as you can see here on the bottom and I
will do this for every single pattern I list the complexity the direction and
the type and in this case it's a complex pattern because it consists of more than one candle it's a bullish pattern
because it indicates a move towards the upside and it's a reversal because it
reverses the price from a downtrend to an uptrend so now then how do we
identify a bullish engulfing pattern well step one here is that we need to see a downtrend and after the downtrend
these two candles appear I hope you can see here that the candles before the pattern uh has a slightly different
color and also the candle here here after the pattern has a slightly different color and I will do this for
all patterns but the actual patterns are these two candles right here the first
candle in this pattern is a red one and preferably we want the real body of the red one to be relatively small it
doesn't have to be super small but it's often a good sign when we have a small real body as for the wigs here it
doesn't matter too much these wigs can be longer or shorter it will not have a big big impact on the pattern the next
candle of the pattern here is more important it's this green candle right here and in order to find a bullish
engulfing we want the next candle to be a green one and it needs to open below
the close of the red one so it needs to open below this point right here and the
green candle needs to close above the open of the red candle and this is why
it's called an engulfing pattern because the green candle is larger and engulfes
the previous red candle if you're trading for example crypto where the closing and the open prices are at the
same level it's enough to see a pattern that looks something like this let's say that this is the first red candle right
here and this right here is the second candle in crypto and some other markets the next candle will open at the same
place as where the previous candle closed so in these scenarios what you are looking out for to confirm bullish
engulfing is simply to see a Candlestick that closes above the previous red one
when the green candle closes then the pattern is confirmed and as I said the
pattern indicates a reversal to the upside now let's take a look at the bullish engulfing pattern and how to
trade it in a real Market all right so right here we have a chart and remember
Bullish Engulfing Trading Strategy
it doesn't really matter what time frame this chart is I think in this case it's a daily chart but you can use
Candlestick patterns on any time frame and if you want to you can try to find the bullish engulfing pattern on your
own so feel free to pause the video right now did you find the pattern well
the bullish engulfing pattern at least the most obvious pattern is this one right here you can see that before the
pattern appeared we had a strong movement to the downside we actually saw a little bounce but then we saw yet
another push towards the downside the first candle is a small red one and the
next candle the green candle oh opens below right and closes above the
previous red candle the most common entry point is to enter when the candle
closes so at the candle close of this green candle but where do we set our
stop- loss well the most common level here is to set the stop loss just below
the lowest point of the pattern so in this case the lowest point comes from this Wick right here but if the red
candle has a lower Wick we usually set the stop loss below that Wick another
important point to consider when you place your stop-loss is previous Market structure and what do I mean by this
well in this case you can actually see that we had a low right here as well and
you can pretty much see that we have a sort of double bottom looking structure here and when we have another low at the
around same level what I like to do is to actually place the stop loss below
the sort of support created by that level so this case you can see that these two lows are pretty much at the
same level but if one low is slightly lower I like to place the stop loss
below so in this case I would set the stop loss around here uh as you also can
see I usually leave some wiggle room right here so if the price you know
comes down to the support once again we have some room for the price to bounce
here before we get stopped out but what about your target level well here you
can keep it simple and use a risk to reward ratio a risk to reward ratio
tells us how much do we gain compared to how much we lose when we take the trade
so for example a risk reward ratio of 1 to2 means that we risk $1 for every $2
in profit or in other words the distance here from the stop loss to our entry
point should be half the length of the distance up to to the profit Target so
in this case our profit Target would be around here now let's switch the
The Bearish Engulfing Pattern
attention here and take a look at the bearish engulfing pattern once again the bearish engulfing pattern is a complex
pattern because it consists of two candlesticks uh the direction here is bearish because the goal of the pattern
is to push the price down and this is yet again A reversal pattern so in this case before the pattern appears we need
to see an uptrend then we see a green candle appearing here with a relatively
small real body uh but in this case you can see that they actually chose to put the Wicks here you can see we have a
wick all the way up here and a wick all the way down here the important thing about the first candle is that the real
body is small and even more importantly what we want to see for the beish engulfing is that the red candle opens
above the body of the green candle and closes below the body of the green
candle so in this case even though the Wicks are above and below the real body
of the red candle this is still a bearish Eng engulfing pattern and when the candle closes the pattern is
confirmed and it indicates a reversal to the downside so now let's take a look at
Bearish Engulfing Trading Strategy
the barish engulfing trading strategy once again feel free to try to identify
the pattern on your own in this case the pattern is pretty clearly visible on the
chart so hopefully you can identify the pattern patter did you find it Well the
bearish engulfing pattern is this one right here you can see that before the pattern appeared we had a strong move to
the upside then we saw a small green candle and especially the candle had a
small real body we had a pretty long lower Wick but the real body is small
then the next massive candle came in here and opened far above the previous
green candle and closed Far Below so this right here is a very clear bearish
engulfing in this case however we did not have any resistance level so the
optimal scenario is let's say that the high were all the way up here and perhaps we had a resistance uh like this
this would be the optimal scenario the bearish engulfing pattern is more significant when it happens at a
resistance level but you can still use the pattern on its own you can for example combine the pattern with other
technical variables like indicators and Market structure but okay so what about
the entry point well once again the most common entry for the barish Eng engulfing pattern is to enter at the
candle close of the red candle the stop- loss we usually place above the highest
point of the pattern and in this case we can see that the highest point is right here once again you can see that I leave
uh some space here for some wiggle room and as I said remember to keep other Market structure in mind so for example
if we have a resistance all the way up here you might want to set your stop- loss above that resistance as for your
Target level to keep it simple we usually use a risk reward ratio a common risk a very common risk reward ratio is
to use a 2 to one so we measure this length right here and our Target length
should be twice as long uh from the entry so in this case our Target would
be right around here another interesting thing to notice about this chart is let's actually take a look at this
pattern right here well here we actually have a bullish engulfing because the first candle is a red one the second
candle is a green one that opens below right opens below the body and closes
above the body of the previous red candle and we can actually see that this bullish engulfing pattern marked the low
of this down move and it actually reversed the price here to the upside all right so now the time has come to
The Hammer Pattern
take a look at one of my personal favorite patterns and this right here is
the hammer pattern this pattern is a simple pattern because it consists of only one Candlestick the direction here
is bullish and the type is reversal so to identify a hammer pattern what we
first need to see remember it's a reversal pattern so before the hammer appears we need to see a move towards
the downside then the actual Hammer appears and that is this candle right here to find a valid Hammer pattern what
we're looking out for is that we're looking out for a small real body like right here and we're looking out for a
long lower Wick and specifically what we want to see here is that the wick the
lower Wick of the pattern should be at least twice the size of the real body
and preferably it should be you know maybe three times or even four times as
large as the real body you can see in this case the wick is maybe three times as large so this right here is a good
Hammer another thing about the hammer is that we want the upper Wick right here
to be preferably very small or the best case scenario here is when we have
pretty much no Wick at all so if we have a pattern that looks you know like this uh and we have no Wick uh this right
here is a perfect hammer and another thing that might sound a bit counterintuitive is that the color of
the pattern can actually be either green or red so it doesn't have to be a green
real body it can be red and still be a valid Hammer so hammer can look
something like this with a red real body however if we you know have to choose
between these patterns the green Hammer is more bullish and is a stronger signal
so preferably we want to see a green candle and once again when the candle
closes the pattern is confirmed and and it indicates a reversal to the upside so
Hammer Pattern Trading Strategy
now then let's take a look at the hammer pattern trading strategy and here on the
chart we actually have three uh valid Hammer patterns so once again if you
want to pause the video and try to identify the patterns all right so the first Hammer we can identify is this
candle right here you can see this green candle that has a pretty small real body
and a long lower Wick and the important part about this candle is that you can clearly see that the wick here is more
than twice the size compared to the real body and here you can also see that before the hammer appeared we actually
saw a massive massive drop towards the downside so when we see a very strong
movement before the hammer appears it can actually make the hammer even stronger this right here is a very
strong reversal signal but what about the other hammers well right here we
actually have another Hammer this one is a bit more you know debatable if this is
a hammer or not but what you can see first of all is that we we do have a
small real body and you can also see that the lower Wick of this pattern is
clearly more than twice the size of the real body but what makes this pattern a
bit shaky here or you know some people might not consider this a hammer and
that is because the upper Wick here is pretty pretty long but in my opinion I
would I would probably still consider this a hammer because the lower Wick is so much longer compared to the upper
week so this could still be considered a hammer and what we also can notice is that before the hammer appeared we saw a
strong move towards the downside and that is a good sign another candle that you might consider a hammer is this
candle right here you can see once again we have a very small real body and we have a long lower Wick but in this case
I would actually not consider this a hammer and that is because we are actually in a move towards the upside
yes we have a small move here before the hammer appears uh but this is not really
enough for me to consider this a reversal pattern preferably before before the pattern appears we want to
see a clear move here towards the downside but the last valid Hammer
pattern here in my opinion is this one right here once again you can see we
have a very small real body we have a very tiny upper Wick right and we have a
very long lower Wick the body is red but remember that doesn't matter this is
still a valid Hammer so in this case what about the entry point the exit point and our Target level well once
again and this is common for many patterns the most common way to enter is to enter at the candle close here of the
pattern and remember this is a red body so we enter at the lowest point of the
body that is when the candle closes but what about the stop loss well in this
case you can actually see that we have some sort of support because we have a low right here we have another low right
here and we have another low right here so what we can do here is that we can
drag a sort of support area I prefer to draw areas rather than uh rather than
sort of lines in this case we can draw a pretty broad support area right here and in this case I think it makes sense here
to place the stop loss below the support area and I also leave some wiggle room
so I leave some wiggle room here between the support and the entry point just
like this and as for our Target level once again we can keep it simple with a 2 to1 risk to reward we measure this
part our Target level should be around twice the length of this part right here
and that would give us a Target around here once again when it comes to Target
levels we can also use support and resistance levels so in this case we can see that we have some sort of resistance
resistance resistance so here we have some sort of resistance area right here so it it can make sense when you have a
resistance area like this to actually Place The Target just below oops uh
wrong tool here just below the resistance so in this case you can actually you know adjust your support
your so in this case you can actually adjust your target a bit here to take targets before the resistance appears
because when we reach a resistance it's pretty common that the price will reverse in this case you can actually
see that we did get a pretty strong reaction of this resistance area it went a tiny bit higher here but definitely
keep support and resistance levels in mind all right so now let's take a look at the shooting star pattern this is one
The Shooting Star Pattern
of my favorite bearish patterns so make sure to really pay attention to this one
once again this is a simple pattern because the pattern consists of one can stick the direction is bearish and the
type is a reversal and because this is a bearish reversal that means that before
the pattern appears we want to see an uptrend then this right here is the
actual pattern and after the pattern the goal is to reverse the price to the downside to identify a shooting star
pattern we want to look out for a small real body and a long upper Weck what we
also want to see is that we want the lower Wick to be either non-existent or to be very small like we're seeing right
here and here and this is very important the upper Wick of the shooting star just
as the hammer we want this this one to be at least twice the size or preferably
even longer compared to the real body here and in this case we can see that
the upper Wick is just barely twice the size as the previous candle so if if
this week was a little bit shorter so if we had a pattern that look something like this instead where the upper week
is you know maybe like this now we are not really seeing a shooting star
anymore so when you're looking out for shooting stars definitely pay close attention to the upper Wick of the
Shooting Star Trading Strategy
pattern all right so now then how do we trade the shooting star well in this
case the shooting star can actually be pretty hard to spot but the most valid
shooting star right here in my opinion is actually this green candle right here
and I actually forgot to mention this but for the shooting star it doesn't matter if the body is green or red it's
still a valid shooting star however a red candle is a bit more bearish but the
important part here is that we have a small real body and a long lower Wick in
this case you can see that the wick is just barely twice the size of the real
body and what we also can see is that before the pattern appeared we had a clear move towards the upside as for
your entry level once again we enter here at the candle close of the pattern and because this is a green body we
enter at the top of the real body um your stoploss level here once again we
want to look out for previous Market structure you can see that we actually have a high right here so we can drag a
resistance like this in this case we can actually see that the shooting star us
quickly peaked above the resistance and then reversed this is actually a special
type of pattern that we call a wof up thrust and these can be very strong
reversal signals and by the way guys if you want to learn more about support and resistance and how to combine support
and resistance with other technical tools to create a trading strategy I highly recommend to watch my support and
resistance trading course here on the channel I will make sure to link that video up in the corner in the eye so now
then where we place our stop- loss well because the highest point of the shooting star is above the resistance we
actually want to place the stop loss used slightly above that point once again I leave a tiny bit of wiggle room
between the highest point of the shooting star and the stop loss and as for our Target level we keep it simple
with a 2 to one for this pattern as well so we measure this move right here and
we take a 2 to one so the target should be twice the size and we lock in our profits around here in this case we can
see that the price actually continued further down but that is no guarantee so it's very important to plan out your
trade set your you know stop loss and set your Target and stick to your plan
another interesting thing you can notice about this chart is that we pretty much had a shooting star pattern appearing
right here right you can see we had a small real body we had a long upper week
but what makes this pattern a bit you know shaky is that yet this we saw a move towards the upside right here but
before the shooting star appeared we had more of a sideways movement a more value
pattern in my opinion would have been this candle right here but in this case you can see that if you traded this
pattern you would have entered right here and you would have probably set your stop loss right here so in this
case this would have been a losing trade and that is a very important point to consider not all patterns will be
successful some patterns will fail and then it's very important to respect your stop- loss and exit the trade without
any hesitation another important thing to remember here is that when we use a risk reward ratio of 1 to2 this means
that we can actually lose more trades than what we win and still make money so
losing trades doesn't have to be a bad thing it's simply a part of the game all right so now it's time for a very iconic
The Morning Star Pattern
and pretty complex reversal pattern and this is the Morning Star pattern this
pattern right here is indeed complex and it's a bullish reversal pattern so
before the pattern appears we want to see a downtrend then the actual pattern appears here and as you can see this
pattern consists of three candlesticks and the goal of this pattern is to reverse the price to the upside so how
do we identify the Morning Star well the first Candlestick of the Morning Star is
a pretty strong red candle and it's a continuation of of the previous move
towards the downside the next candle is a green Candlestick with a small real
body and the wick here can be either small or long but here and this is very
important between the candle close of the red candle and the opening of the
green candle so in this space right here we actually want to see a Gap a gap is
when we either have distance between the body of the candle or another gap which
is called a wick Gap is when we actually have distance between the Wicks of the
candles as well and I will talk more about that later on in this video we actually have some patterns where we
need to see uh Wick gaps but in this case all you need to see is that we want to see a gap between the bodies of the
candles and the third and the final candle of the pattern is a strong green
candle and here we once again want to see a gap between the small green candle
and the large green candle so we want to see a gap between the real bodies of these two candles yet another thing we
want to see with the green candle is that preferably we want the green candle to close well within the real body of
the red candle and a rule you can use if this right here is 50% or in other words
it's in the middle of the red candle we want the green candle to close above
this Mark right here and when the green candle closes above the 50% Mark the
Morning Star pattern is confirmed all right so now let's take a look at the Morning Star Trading strategy and The
Morning Star Trading Strategy
Morning Star can be identified right here and this one can be a little bit
tricky to spot here but let's take a look at this pattern together so the first candle is a strong red candle that
clearly comes after a downtrend a very strong movement here towards the
downside the second candle of this pattern has first of all it has a very
small uh real body that is a good sign and you can see here that we actually have a pretty long lower week so what
pattern is this pretty much well it's actually pretty much a hammer pattern so you can actually find a hammer pattern
inside a Morning Star pattern and it's a bit hard to see here but we actually created some space SP between the real
body of the first candle and the second candle between candle 2 and candle 3
here we have a much clearer Gap here you can see we clearly have a gap between the red candle and the green one and
what you also can notice here is that the green candle closes above the candle
close here is above the 50% Mark of the first red candle so as for our entry
point the most common way to enter is to enter at the candle close of the shooting star so to enter right there in
this case when we have a hammer pattern you could have actually entered all the way down here on the Hammer as well but
in this example we are showing off the Morning Star so let's stick with entry example number one let's take a look at
our stop- loss here we don't really have any clear support level and when we don't have any clear support we usually
place the stop here below the lowest point of the pattern so we place it below this point right here we also
leave some wiggle room space between the low and the the and the stop loss so if
the price falls down here we can actually retest the the hammer pattern
and still you know not get stopped out as for your Target level we can keep it simple and use a 2 to one this would
give us a Target around here or we can actually use previous Market structure so in this case you can see that we have
a pretty clear resistance all the way up here you can see we have One Touch two
touches so it's actually possible to set your target just below that resistance
I'm not really sure here but if I remember correctly I do think that we saw a move towards the upside and then down and then this target eventually got
The Evening Star Pattern
reached all right so now let's take a look at the evening star pattern the evening star is a complex pattern
because it consists of three candlesticks the direction is bearish and this is once again A reversal
pattern so before the pattern appears we have an uptrend then the actual pattern is this one right here consisting of
three candles and the goal of the pattern is to reverse the price to the downside the first candle of this
pattern is a strong green one so we want to see a long body here and we can also
see some Wicks the important part about the first candle is that we have a long green body the next candle is a candle
with a small real body so in this case you can see that we have a very small real body here uh we can also have uh
both both lower and upper Wicks this is not super important the most important part here is that we have a small real
body we can even have a canos sticks that looks something like this where the real body is so small that you can't
even see it anymore this right here is a doe candle and we will talk more about
dogee candles and why they are so important later on in this video and also this candle can be either green or
red but one could consider the pattern a bit more bearish if we see a red candle
between the body of the first candle and the second candle and this is very important we need to see a gap so
between this point and this point we want to see a gap here between the real
bodies the third candle here is a strong red candle and once again between the
real body of candle 2 and the real body of candle 3 we want to see a gap like
this and to confirm that the third candle is strong and to confirm the pattern we want the red Candlestick or
candle 3 to close below this point right here and in this particular example you
can see that the red candle closed far below the 50% Mark and this confirms the
evening star pattern all right then so how do we actually trade the evening star well the first thing we need to do
Evening Star Trading Strategy
is of course to identify the pattern so if you want to try to do this yourself and pause the video did you manage to
find the pattern well the evening star is this pattern right here you can see
that the first candle is a strong green one that comes after a move towards the upside the second candle right here has
a small real body in this case the real body was green but remember the body can be either green or red and this pattern
on its own is actually something we call a hanging man pattern and we will cover that pattern later on in this course but
for now all we need to notice is that we do have a small pattern and also very importantly we do have a gap here
between the real body of the green one and the real body of the first candle so you can see we have a pretty clear Gap
right here the third candle is a strong bearish candle that's exactly what we want to see and even though it's tiny we
can see that we do have a gap here between candle 2 and candle 3 and also
the red candle closes below the 50% Mark of candle one so you can see that the
candle close is clearly below that point so we have all our criteria and this
pattern is confirmed as for your entry point we usually enter here at the candle close of the third candle and for
the stop loss once again we don't really have any clear support and resistance here so our stop loss we want to place
above this point so we place it above we leave some wiggle room right here and we
use a risk to reward ratio uh we can use for example a 2 to one could also use a
3:1 a 3:1 risk reward simply means that the reward uh the length down to the
Target so the length down to this point right here should be three times as long
as this length right here all right so now the time has come to take a look at the piercing pattern and the piercing
The Piercing Pattern
pattern is yet another Super useful uh reversal pattern and this pattern is complex because it consists of two
candlesticks the direction here is bull and as I said the type here is reversal
so before the pattern appears we need to see a downtrend then these two candles right here are the actual pattern and
the goal of the pattern is to reverse the price to the upside the first Candlestick of this pattern is a red one
preferably a pretty strong red candle but it can be either strong or sort of
medium strength and the red candle is a continuation of the previous move to the
downside the next Candlestick is a strong green candle it can have a upper
Wick and a lower Wick but the most important thing about this green candle
is that we need to close above remember just as with the morning and evening
star we have this 50% line from the red candle and this line goes from the
middle of the previous red candle and what we want to see in order to confirm the piercing pattern is that we want the
green candle to close above this line when we see the candle close the pattern
is confirmed and indicates the reversal to the upside what I also forgot to mention here is that the red previous
candle can also have a upper and a lower Wick so now let's take a look at the
Piercing Pattern Trading Strategy
piercing pattern trading strategy and as always you can as an exercise try to
find the pattern here on your own but the piercing pattern can be found right
here you can see that before the pattern appeared we had a pretty significant move here towards the downside candle
one here is a strong red candle we have a slight upper Wick and lower Wick but
that's okay the next candle here is a strong green candle you can see that we
do have a very long lower week and we do have a very long upper week but that's
completely fine because remember the most important part about this pattern is that the green candle needs to close
up Above This 50% line we have right here and you can see that the candle
close was quite far above the 50% line so when this candle closes the pattern
is confirmed another important thing to notice about the piercing pattern is that this is pretty much a early stage
of a bullish engulfing because if the piercing pattern pushes a bit higher here and closes above the opening of the
red candle then we actually have a bullish engulfing pattern instead so this is pretty much an early sort of
bullish engulfing pattern but now let's take a look at where do we enter where do we set our stop loss and where do we
place our Target well the most common entry point is as usual at the candle
close so we enter here when the pattern confirms as for our stop-loss we usually
look at the very lowest point of the pattern and in this case remember we have a very sort of long lower Weck so
what we usually do is that we actually set the stop loss all the way down here all the way below the lower week and I
also like as you know by now I like to leave some wiggle room here this allows
us for the pattern to go down and test the low once again and then bounce and
we will still not get stopped out and as always you also want to look out for the previous Market structure in this case
you can see we have a low right here uh and we have a lower low uh in this case
uh we don't have an indicator right now but just by looking at the price I can actually sense a sort of Divergence
right here if you want to learn more about divergences to improve your Candlestick pattern trading even more I
actually have a full course about the RSI indicator that I highly recommend watching I will make sure to leave a
link to that video somewhere up in the corner but now then what about the target well our usual method here is to
measure the length between the entry and the stop stop loss and we use a risk
reward ratio a risk reward ratio of two would give us a target maybe somewhere around here so this is where our Target
is and where we lock in profit all right so now we're going to take a look at the dark cloud cover this right here is an
The Dark Cloud Cover Pattern
important bearish pattern that every Trader needs to know about this pattern is complex because it consists of two
candles the direction is bearish and the type is reversal so before the pattern
we want to see an uptrend these two candles right here are the actual pattern and the goal of this pattern is
to reverse the price down the first candle of this pattern is this candle right here and this is a pretty strong
green candle it can be either very strong or medium size it doesn't matter
here if we have an upper Wick and a lower Wick the most important part here is that we have a clear continuation of
the uptrend the next candle candle two is a strong bearish candle and in this
example you can see that we have no upper week and this is completely fine but we have a pretty long lower week and
that's also completely fine the Wicks of this pattern are not the most important part the most important part is that the
red candle needs to close below this 50% Mark of the green candle so once again
the 50% Mark is drawn from the middle of the body of the green candle and what
we're looking out for here is that we are looking out for a candle close below this line when we see a candle close
below the 50% line the pattern is confirmed and indicates a reversal so
Dark Cloud Cover Trading Strategy
now then let's take a look at the dark cloud cover trading strategy and the first thing we need to do is that we
need to identify the pattern and the dark cloud cover can actually be found
right here and this right here is pretty much a special case of the dark cloud
cover because the second candle here is you know a massive massive candle and as
you can see first of all we had a very clear move towards the upside before the pattern appears and the first candle
here is a pretty strong green one and importantly it's a continuation of the uptrend in this particular case we have
no upper Wick and we have no lower Wick but that's completely fine the second
candle in this case was a massive massive bearish candle and the very interesting thing about this candle is
that during the candle the price pushed all the way up here but before the
candle closed the bars managed to push the price all the way down here and even
more importantly the bars managed to push the price and close below the 50%
Mark of the previous green candle so this actually confirms that we have a dark cloud cover and even though we have
such a large candle and such a large large upper lower week this is still a dark cloud cover but now then how do we
trade a dark cloud cover with you know such a big bearish candle well the first
step is to find our entry point here and once again the most common entry is to enter here at the candle close of this
pattern but as for the stop- loss here it gets a bit more tricky we still have
the most common stop- loss that is you know if we take a look at the absolute highest point of the pattern as you guys
know from previous patterns the most common way to set your stop- loss is to set your stop- loss just above this
point but now since the highest week is so high up some Traders highly prefer to
to not have such a wide stop loss so when you see a a large second candle
like we're seeing right here another method to set your stop- loss is to actually place it above the candle close
of the pattern so some Traders might prefer for this stop loss you can see we set the stop loss just above the uh real
body of the pattern and as always we also leave some wiggle room so here you
have two uh pretty valid options for your stop- loss you have the higher stop loss and you have the lower stop- loss
and what stop loss you decide to choose here basically depends on your own trading style if we choose the lower
stop loss then our Target level using a 2 to one would probably take us down
around here so this right here is Target Target one but if you're using the wider
stop loss and still aim to get a 2 to1 risk reward ratio you also of course
have to increase the target so in this case your target level might be all the
The Inverted Hammer Pattern
way down here all right so the next pattern we're going to take a look at is the inverted Hammer pattern and this
pattern is you know very important to understand because it can be quite uh counterintuitive
because this right here is a simple bullish pattern and it is a reversal pattern but many uh especially new
Traders look at this pattern and say isn't this a bearish pattern well it's
actually considered a bullish pattern and we will talk about why this is considered a bullish pattern very soon
but first how do we identify the pattern well since this is a bullish reversal before the pattern we need to see a
downtrend and in this case the context this very important so it is important that we have a down move before the
pattern then the actual pattern appears and the goal of the pattern is to quickly push the price towards the
upside the pattern itself consists of one single candle with a very small real
body and a long upper Wick and here just
as with the hammer pattern we want the wick to be at least twice the size
compared to the real body and in this case you can see that the wick is maybe you know four times as large as the real
body so that is a very good sign but now you may of course wonder why is this
even a bullish pattern because if you remember from earlier in the video when we talk about talked about the shooting
star you can actually see that this right here is the same candle as the
shooting star because as you can see the candle open all the way down here during
the candle the Bulls started off good they managed to push the price all the
way up here but before the candle closed the bars took control once again and
pushed the price all the way down to this point right here but the reason this is still considered a bullish
pattern is because of the context because before the pattern appeared we had a clear move towards the downside
and because the Bulls during the next candle managed to push the price all the way up here this gives us an indication
that the back s from the downtrend might be losing control so if you see this
pattern appear after a downtrend it's a bullish pattern but if you see the
pattern appear after an uptrend it's a bearish pattern so the context is very
important but when this candle closes the candle is confirmed and indicates a reversal to the upside when trading the
inverted Hammer many Traders will actually wait for a confirmation candle and what is a confirmation candle well
in this case this right here is a confirmation candle it's a candle that
appears after the pattern that confirms the direction we want to see and in this
case we want to see a move towards the upside and we can see here that the next candle confirmed this move so some
Traders will wait for this next candle close before they enter their trade and
in my opinion waiting for a confirmation candle when it comes to the inverted Hammer is not about idea because this
pattern is you know slightly less bullish compared to for example the hammer pattern and as you can hear on
the name the inverted Hammer pattern is basically a hammer upside down so now
Inverted Hammer Trading Strategy
let's take a look at the inverted Hammer trading strategy and if you want to pause the video and try to find the
pattern on your own did you guys succeed well the inverted Hammer here can be
pretty hard to spot but it can be found right here you can see that before the
inverted Hammer appeared we had a pretty significant move towards the downside
especially the last candle here before the inverted Hammer was a very strong bearish one then as you can see right
here we saw an inverted Hammer up here why is this an inverted Hammer well we have a small real body and a long upper
Wick and this Wick needs to be at least twice the size of the real body and in
this case we can see that it is slightly more than twice the size of the body but how do we actually trade this pattern
well in this case we have two different ways to enter the first potential entry
point is to enter here at the Cano close of the inverted Hammer but as we talked about a second way to enter is to wait
for a confirmation candle in this case this next Green candle here is a
confirmation candle it confirms the pattern because it pushes in a bullish Direction and that is exactly what this
pattern indicates and what about our stop-loss level well the most sensible
uh stop- loss Point here at least in my opinion is to look out for the lowest point of the candle that happened before
the inverted Hammer when you see candles like this that Wicks below the actual
pattern uh you know before the pattern appears a good way to set your stop- loss is to place it below this point and
also of course I leave some wiggle room here so if the buyers take control here we we actually have a chance of a bounce
at the low and still not get stopped out as for your Target level here if you use
the first entry you can see that we have a very tight stop loss uh this is something that you know some Traders
prefer and some Traders like to avoid and when we use such a tight stop- loss you can see that if we use our risk
reward ratio of two you can see that our Target uh gets reached very very quickly
so if you are a Trader that likes to get in and out of the market quickly tight stop losses can be a good idea if we
instead use the confirmation candle entry here we will have a much wider
Target if we once again use a risk reward reward of 2 to one you can see that our Target would some be probably
be somewhere up here and this is a pretty interesting point because this uh as you can see between this candle and
this candle we actually had a very large gap and we will talk more about price
gaps later on in this video but a common principle here is that price gaps tends to be filled so the
highest point of the Gap here can actually many times act as resistance so
it does make sense here to set your target level here uh just before the Gap
close or in other words before the resistance because when the price reaches or if the price reaches all the
way up there it's very possible that we can actually see a reaction all right so now let's take a look at the hanging man
The Hanging Man Pattern
pattern uh the hanging man is a pretty pretty wild name here uh but the pattern
is a simple pattern it consists of only one Candlestick the direction here is
bearish and the type is a reversal so before the pattern appears we have an
uptrend then this right here is the actual pattern and the goal here is to reverse the price to the downside and
the hanging man pattern is another pretty counter intuitive pattern because as you can see this pattern actually
looks like a hammer right it's pretty much the exact same candle as a hammer
the key difference between the hanging man and a hammer pattern is the context
so where on the chart does the pattern appear and in this case it's very important that in order to have a
hanging man it needs to appear after an uptrend the pattern itself consists of a
small real body and a long lower Wick and what we want to see here is that we
want the wick here to be at least twice the length of the real body so at least
twice the length here uh in this particular case it looks to be more like three times uh and that is a good sign
but why is this a bearish pattern well remember here that before the pattern we have an uptrend and then the pattern
appears here and during this pattern we can see that the bulls actually took lots of control and managed to push the
the price all the way down here we can actually see that in this particular case the bulls actually quickly managed
to break the lowest point of the previous candle but before the candle closes uh the price pushed all the way
up here so even though the Bulls took control here this is still a bearish pattern because the bearish move all the
way down here shows a clear uh disruption in the uptrend and just as
with the inverted Hammer some Traders when they see a hanging man wants to see
a confirmation candle so they find this pattern uh this pattern confirms with
the candle close but then they wait for one more bearish candle before they
actually enter the trade and also the color of the real body can actually be
either red or green but for the hanging man pattern I personally uh highly
prefer when we see a red body because if we see a green body it's very possible
that this move is just a continuation of the uptrend all right so here we have a
Hanging Man Trading Strategy
real life example of the hanging man pattern and this chart right here can be
you know pretty hard to read so it's pretty impressive if you can find the
hanging man pattern on your own here so where's the hanging man well we can
identify the hanging man right here and one reason why this hanging Man is Hard
to spot here is because the move you can see before the pattern appeared we did have a strong move here towards the
upside but you can see that we actually have a slightly bearish candle just before the pattern appears and this
right here is something we actually don't prefer we prefer to see a green candle before the hanging man but the
most important part here is that the overall move before the hanging man is a
move towards the upside and here we can still see that the overall move before the pattern is an upwards movement and
if we take a look at the actual pattern we can see that we have a small real body the body is red so that is a good
sign and we also have a long lower Wick that looks to be around uh three times
the size of the real body when it comes to the entry point for this pattern it can also be a little bit tricky as
always the most straightforward entry point is to enter right here at the candle close of the hanging man but
remember that the other strategy was to wait for a confirmation candle and you can see that this next candle right here
was a red candle but this is actually not a confirmation candle because in order to be a confirmation candle we
want to confirm a a move towards the downside after the pattern and in order
to confirm a move towards the downside we want to see you know a candle that at least closes lower than the uh hanging
man so this candle is not good enough to be a confirmation candle however if we
take a look at the next candle here we can see that the price gapped down you can see we created a gap here between
these two candles and we clearly pushed lower so in this case the second entry would actually be all the way down here
at least in my opinion but what about our stop-loss level well here we also
have some important Market structure you can see we have one high right here and
we have another high right here so here we can actually mark up a resistance area on the chart and when a bearish p
appears at or very close a resistance level what I like to do is to place the
stop loss just above the resistance because then we can allow uh for the
price to go up here and get reacted and still be within a winning trade but what
about our Target level well as usual we want to measure the distance between the
stop loss and the entry point and if we use a risk reward ratio of two our Target would be somewhere around here
and if we use a risk reward ratio of three then our Target would be somewhere down here um your choice of risk reward
will depend a bit on your trading style a lower risk reward like a one to two
will make it more likely that you trade suceed but if you use a risk reward of
for example 1 to three like we do right here it will be less likely that your
trade succeed but when you actually get a successful trade you will win much more all right so so now it's time to
Best Continuation Candlestick Patterns
switch the attention and take a look at the best continuation Candlestick patterns and first of all what are
continuation patterns well continuation patterns indicate that the trend will
continue or in other words they indicate that we will go from a bullish to a
bullish Trend or from bearish to a bearish trend and continuation patterns
can be super effective because you are trading in the same direction as the trend and as you guys know the trend is
your friend when it comes to continuation patterns the patterns are often complex or in other words the
patterns will very seldom consist of only one Candlestick they will pretty much always be uh you know a bit larger
patterns and when it comes to continuation pattern the location on the chart or in other words the context of
the patterns are super super important so when we talk about continuation patterns make sure to you know pay extra
attention to the context and location of the patterns okay so let's take a look
The Rising Three Methods Pattern
at the rising three methods pattern and as you guys can see this right here is a pretty large pattern so it's definitely
a complex pattern because this one consists of five candlesticks the direction of this pattern is bullish and
the type here is continuation so it's very important that before this pattern appears we need to see an uptrend then
all of these candles together are the actual pattern and the goal of this pattern is to continue the trend towards
the upside and the first candle of the Rising 3 methods is a strong bullish
candle and this pattern indicates that the Bulls are still in control of the uptrend but after this candle what we
are looking out for here is that we are looking out for three small bearish
candles so we're looking out for a small move that goes in the opposite direction
of the trend or in in other words we're actually looking out for a small pullback and these three candles should
preferably be within this range so if we take from the highest point to the
lowest point of the previous bullish candle we want the red candles here to
be within this range as for the Wicks here of the small red candles it's okay
here to have Wicks on all of these candles the important Point here is that we want to have small real bodies of
these candles the last candle of the Rising 3 methods is very important here
we want to see a strong bullish candle and what we want to see here is that we want this bullish candle to close above
the close of the first candle so you can see right here we have the close of the
first candle and we want the final candle to close above this line when we
get this candle close the rising three methods is confirmed and in indicates a continuation up okay so now how do we
Rising Three Methods Trading Strategy
actually trade the rising three methods well the first thing we need to do is that we need to identify the pattern and
the rising three methods can actually be found right here first of all you can
see that before the pattern appears we have a very strong movement towards the upside once again you can see that we
actually have a gap here we have a massive massive Gap and we will talk more about gaps later on in this video
it's important to learn about gaps but for now let's focus here on the Rising 3 methods and we can also see here that
the first candle is a strong green candle in this case we have you know a pretty long Wick but that's completely
fine the next three candles you can see here that we have three small red
candles with very small real bodies and that is exactly what we want to see but
here and this is actually on the edge we can see that the third red candle is
almost pushing a bit too low here if we take a look here we can see that the real body the the red real body is
contained within the first green and that is exactly what we want to see I
think I forgot to mention this in the previous slide but you can see that the important part here is that the real
bodies of the red candles uh should be contained within this range it's not the
end of the world if we have a lower Wick right here but preferably we want at least the real bodies of the candles to
be contained within that last but not least we have the final candle and remember in order to have a valid Rising
three methods we want that final candle to close above this line right here and
here you can see that this candle just slightly slightly managed to close above
that point and that confirms the rising three methods as for your entry point the most common way to enter is to enter
here at the candle close of the last candles some Traders wait for a confirmation here but because this last
candle is a strong bullish one I definitely don't think you need to wait for confirmation for the Rising 3
methods entering at the candle close of the fifth candle is often a good idea as
for your stop- loss the most common way to place it is to place it below the lowest point of the whole pattern and in
this case you can see that the lowest point of the whole pattern is right here but sometimes the lowest point of the
pattern will actually be created from the first candle as well so here you need to be a little bit flexible uh but
in this case because we had the third red candle wicking below uh we actually
have the stoploss placement right there I always leave some space here for some wiggle room so I set my stop loss around
there to get your target level here we actually have because we have a continuation pattern we have many different methods uh the first method is
to use a use a fixed wrist reward so we measure this movement uh if we use a 2
to one our Target will be right around here but when it comes to continuation patterns we can also use something
called a measured move so what we basically do is that we measure the whole impulse that created the whole
sort of move towards the upside before the pattern and then we take this exact measurement and measure uh the same
length so the length of this arrow and this Arrow should be the same length and then we take our Target all the way up
here this method is something called the 100% measured move and I talk more about
that in our Market structure trading course here on the Channel all right so now it's time to take a look at the
The Falling Three Methods Pattern
following three methods pattern and this right here is a pretty large pattern
consisting of five candlesticks or in other words it's a complex pattern the
direction is bearish and the type is continuation so before this pattern
appears we need to see a downtrend then we see the actual pattern and the goal of the pattern is to continue to push
the price down the first Candlestick of the pattern is a large red candle or at
least a medium length red candle and this candle is simply the continuation
of the previous downtrend it's okay to have a upper Weck and it's okay to have a lower Weck and it's not too important
if these Wicks are long or short after the first candle what we're looking out for here is we're looking out for three
small candles that goes in the opposite direction or in other words we're
talking about a pullback these candles can also have wicks for example this candle right here you can see have
pretty large Wicks and to be specific this right here is actually a spinning top candle and we will talk more about
spinning tops and why they are important later on in this video but the important
part about these three candles is that the real bodies of these candles should
be contained between between the low of the first candle and the high of the
first candle it's fine if we do see a wick below or even a week above but
preferably we want all of the bodies of the candles to be within this range the
final candle of the pattern is yet another strong bearish one once again we can have Wicks on this candle but the
most important part here is that the fifth candle closes below the candle
close of the first candle so the candle close of the first candle is right here
so we want the last candle to at least close below this point and you can see
in this particular example we got a candle close far below uh the close of
the first candle so that is a very good sign this final red candle indicates that this sort of pullback is over and
that we are likely to see a continuation to the downside all right so now let's
Falling Three Methods Trading Strategy
take a look at the falling three methods in in a real market and as always the very first thing we need to do is to
identify the pattern you can try to identify the pattern on your own and pause the video now did you find the
pattern well the following three methods can be found right here you can see
these five candles as we can see here the first candle is a strong bearish
candle and this is a continuation of the downtrend next we have 1 2 and three
small green candles that creates a pullback or consolidation within the
downtrend and remember here we want the real bodies of these three green candles
to be contained within this range and here we can see that all of these green
candles are indeed in this range right here the final candle should be a strong red candle and we can see that we found
a strong red candle right here and remember this candle needs to close
below the close of the first candles so we need to close below this point and
here we can once again clearly see that we got a candle close below so now then where do we enter and where do we place
our stop loss and where do we take our profits well the entry point is pretty straightforward the most common entry
point is to enter at the close of the fifth candle so you enter right here and
as we have been talking about some Traders wait for a confirmation candle but for the folling three methods I think uh personally that the best entry
point is used to enter at the fifth candle as for your stop loss you want to place your stop loss above the highest
point so here this right here is the highest point of all the candles within
the pattern so we place our stop- loss just above this point and we also leave
some wiggle room right here as for your Target level you can either keep it simple with a risk reward ratio so you
measure this length right here you take this measurement you double it and your target will be somewhere around here
yet another way to take targets is to measure the whole impulsive move down and then you take this exact measurement
and you measure from the high of the pattern uh and you take the Target down here so in this case the second target
would be a little bit earlier right around here the important thing about the second target method is that the
length of this move and the length of this move should be equal size all right
The Bullish Momentum Candle
so the next pattern we're going to take a look at is the bullish momentum um pattern and this right here is one of my
favorite patterns because it's pretty easy to identify and they can also provide very strong signals so let's
first take a look at this pattern so this pattern we can actually consider a simple pattern Because the actual
pattern is only one Candlestick however the it's very important that we compare
this Candlestick with the previous candles and I will talk more about that later on and as we can hear on the name
this right here is a bullish pattern and this right here is a continuation
pattern I would say but you can actually also use this pattern as a reversal
pattern uh but most commonly I would say it's a continuation pattern so let's classify this as a continuation so
before this pattern we preferably want to see an uptrend but after this uptrend
the price should enter a sort of sideways or consolidation face this
movement can be slightly upwards or it can actually also be sideways or even
slightly downwards then the actual pattern appears and the goal of this pattern is to continue the price upwards
and how do we identify this pattern well what we're looking out for here is that we're looking out for a strong green
candle so we want the real body of the candle to be very long um the upper week
we can have a upper Weck and we can have a longer week but for the momentum pattern I actually prefer if we have a
shorter weeks but we can have longer weeks as well but the most important part about this pattern is that we want
this Candlestick right here to be at least two times as large as the real
bodies of the previous candles and here the question is of course you know how many candles should we measure Traders
have slightly different methods but I recommend that you measure measure at least three candles before the pattern
appears so we want the candle to be twice the size uh the real body should
be twice the size as at least the three previous candles I hope this doesn't
sound confusing but what we basically do for this pattern is that we compare the size of the Candlestick bodies so now
Bullish Momentum Trading Strategy
let's take a look at a bullish momentum trading strategy and as always the first thing we need to do is to identify the
pattern so remember remember to find a bullish momentum candle we need to compare candles with previous candles
and actually if you look at this candle right here you can see that this right here is a pretty strong bullish candle
it's for example it's not as strong as this candle and not as strong as this candle but what is important about this
candle is that the real body is twice the size compared to all of the previous
candles so we can actually consider this right here a bullish momentum candle and
another thing that is very important in this case is that we actually have you can see we have a resist pretty clear
resistance level right here you can see the price got reacted you know one time two time three time and here the price
was just hovering very close to the resistance and another thing we can notice is that the price is actually
printing as you can see higher lows into the resistance as well so in this
particular case it looks like like we actually have some sort of ascending triangle pattern and by the way guys if
you want to learn more about chart patterns I actually have a full chart pattern trading course here on my
YouTube channel so I will make sure to link that video somewhere up in the corner in the eye and I highly recommend
that you guys check that video out after you are done with this video but now then so how do we trade this pattern
well the most common method is to Simply enter at the candle close of the
momentum candle some Traders wait for confirmation but in this case I think the confirmation you know after the
confirmation we are already very high up and most of the times I actually prefer to enter right after the momentum candle
when it comes to your stop-loss level for your momentum candle here it's very important to consider the market
structure so remember here we actually have a sort of triangle pattern with
consecutive higher lows and in this case I would actually place my stop loss
below the most recent low this is the common method for the ascending triangle
and I would I would actually handle this as an ascending triangle so the stop loss level I would actually place just
slightly below this point so as always we leave some wiggle room and as for our
Target we can either measure uh the length up to the entry we take this
measurement with a 2 to1 risk reward our Target would be right around around here another method is to actually measure
the the um triangle here so you can take this measurement measure from the breakout and you will also get to Target
something like this so what I did right here if it wasn't clear is that I took
this exact length uh I sort of took that exact length and I measured from the
breakout point I took that measurement and our Target level would have been around here but now a question you all
might have at this point is you know can't we find any other momentum candles
right here for example isn't this right here a momentum candle because we can see that this candle is a very strong
green candle well if we look closely here at the previous candles we can
actually see that the real body of this candle right here is probably you know
at least half the size compared to this candle so this isn't really a momentum
candle once again if we look at this candle right here we can see that we have a strong bullish candle the candle
is clearly uh twice the size of this candle and this candle but if you look
at the third candle this candle right here we you see that the size of that candle is actually smaller the only real
uh momentum candle we can actually find here is this barish candle right here uh
or we actually only have two candles visible here but I'm pretty sure the third candle was also uh less than half
the size of this candle right here so this was probably a bearish momentum candle and we will talk more about
bearish momentum candles next all right guys so now it's time to take a look at the bearish momentum pattern this right
The Bearish Momentum Candle
here is a very useful pattern because it appears so frequently in the market the
pattern is a simple pattern because it consists of only one Candlestick so Weir
the pattern appears on the chart is key the direction for this pattern is bearish and the type is continuation uh
once again this pattern can also act in some cases as a reversal pattern but most common this is a continuation
pattern so before the pattern appears preferably we want to see a move towards the downside then we want to see at
least three candles with relatively small bodies and this candle right here
is the actual pattern and when this pattern confirms it indicates a continuation of the downtrend so now
then how do we identify the bearish momentum pattern well what we're looking out for here is that we're looking out
for a strong bearish candle and specifically we want the body of this
candle to be at least twice the size of the previous candles I'm using three
candles here as a rule of thumb but it's even better if the body of the bearish candle is more than twice the size than
maybe the prev previous four candles or even the previous you know five candles
the more candles the better and the more candles the stronger the bearish momentum is we also preferably want to
see the real body of the red candle be perhaps you know three times as large or even four times as large as the previous
candles so now let's take a look at the bearish momentum trading strategy and as
Bearish Momentum Trading Strategy
always the very first thing we need to do is that we need to identify the pattern and in this case the bearish
momentum pattern can be found right here as you guys can see on this red candle
we have a very long real body and the body is definitely more than twice the
size compared to all of these previous candles and remember that I said that this is most often a continuation
pattern so before the pattern preferably we want to see a downtrend but in this case you can actually see that the price
were in a trading range before the pattern appears and this is also
completely fine you can actually trade the bearish momentum candle both as continuations but also reversals but now
what about the entry point the stop- loss and Target level well the most straightforward entry point is where the
momentum candle closes so enter right here as for your stop- loss we have a
few different options here one stop- loss is to place the stop uh just above
the highest point of the moment momentum candle but what we also can do is that we can look at previous Market structure
so in this case remember that we had a trading range so we found some sort of resistance resistance resistance
resistance so what we can do here is that we can actually draw a resistance Zone and one option is to actually place
the stop loss all the way above the resistance but as you can see when we have the stop loss all the way up there
the stop will be very very wide so yet another option here is to actually
Define the low of the range so we can Define the sort of support uh area right
here so if you prefer a tighter stop you can set the stop loss just above the previous support because a common
principle in trading is that when we break previous support many times it will flip to become resistance in the
future so if we use this stop placement we can actually allow for the price to come up and test this previous support
as as resistance and we are still within a winning trade as for your profit
Target you can either as always you can either use a risk reward ratio so you take this measurement and you measure
using a risk reward ratio of two your target would be right around here right
but when we have trading ranges we can actually also measure the the range so
from high to low of the range and then we take this measurement and measure here from the breakout so we take the
same length and our Target would be right around here all right guys so now it's finally time to take a look at the
The Bull Flag Pattern
bull flag pattern and this right here is one of the best uh Candlestick patterns
out there uh you may wonder why well this pattern appears super frequently in
the market it's a reliable pattern and if you understand it it's also relatively simple to trade but first of
all this right here is a complex pattern because it consists of multiple candlesticks the direction here as you
can hear on the name is bullish and the type here is continuation so before the
pattern appears we need to see an uptrend then the actual pattern appears and the goal of this pattern is to
continue the price towards the upside to identify the bull flag pattern what we're looking out for the first candle
here is a green candle this candle can be uh you know either strong or medium
size it doesn't matter too much and we can have Wicks uh both an upper week and
a lower week the next part of the pattern is that we want to see multiple small candles that goes in the opposite
direction so for the bull flag we want to see multiple red candles preferably
but it can also be a mix here between red and green candles the most important part is that the overall direction of
these small candles should be either down or it can almost go sideways as
well these candles can have both upper and lower Wicks but the important part here is that we wanted the candles to
have relatively small real bodies the last candle of this pattern is a green candle and we want this green candle to
be at least medium siiz preferably we want to see a strong green candle but
what we are looking out for here is that we want we want the green candle to close above the opening of the last
candle in the pullback so you can see the last candle open right here so we want the green candle to close above
this point and in this case you can see that the green candle clearly closed above that point after this the pattern
is confirmed and it indicates continuation to the upside so now let's take a look at the bull flag training
Bull Flag Trading Strategy
strategy and as always the first thing we need to do is to identify the pattern so feel free to pause the video and try
to do this on your own did you find any flag well in my opinion the most obvious
flag is this moment right here here you can see that before the pattern we had a
clear uptrend then we saw 1 2 3 and four
small candles that went in the opposite direction of the trend and this right
here was actually far from a perfect bull flag but it's important to understand that when you are trading in
real markets you will very seldom find these sort of textbook perfect patterns
more often than not the patterns will not be perfect and we as Traders need to be able to trade regardless and you may
wonder why is this pattern not perfect well in my opinion the real body of this
candle right here is a bit too large preferably we want this candle uh at
least the real body of the candle to be smaller but this is still good enough
after the four candles you can see that we do see a green candle finally emerging and what you also can notice is
that this green candle closes above this line right here remember this line is
Crea from the opening of the last Red candle and it is when this candle closes
the bull flag is confirmed so how do we enter how do we place our stop- loss and how do we take targets well the most
common entry point for the bull flag is to Simply enter at the candle close of
the green candle some Traders also wait for a confirmation candle so they wait to enter all the way up here but many
times it's enough to enter at the candle close of the green candle as for your stop- loss the stop- loss is usually set
below the lowest point of the flag so right here we have the lowest point of the flag so we set our stop loss below
that point we leave some wiggle room and when it comes to the Target level here we actually have multiple options one
target option is to actually take profits already at this point which is the high of the uptrend in this uptrend
you can see we have a high right here we have a high we printed another high and a common method is to take either
partial profits meaning that you offload some of your position at this point or
that you take full profit at this level another Target method is to use something called a measured move
objective and what you do here is that you measure the impulsive move of the trend so you measure from low to high
and you take that exact length and you measure from the low of the pattern so this would give you guys a Target around
here and as I said some Traders use this right here as the first Target so they take some profits at this level and then
they might take the rest of the profit all the way up here all right so now it's time to take a look at the bare
The Bear Flag Pattern
flag pattern and the bar flag is a complex pattern because it consists of more than one Candlestick the direction
here is bearish and the type is continuation so before the pattern
appears we want to see a downtrend then we see the actual pattern and the goal here is to continue the price towards
the downside to identify the bar flag the first Candlestick we're looking out for is a red candle uh preferably we
want to see either a strong red candle or a medium siiz red candle it can have
an upper Wick in this case it doesn't it can have a lower Wick the next part here of the pattern is that we want to
identify multiple candles three or more that goes in the opposite direction of
the actual Trend these candles can be either green or red and they can also be dogee candles like we're seeing right
here this right here is a dogee this right here is a dogee but the important part here is that we want to see small
real bodies of the candles and we want the movement to be in the opposite direction the last candle of the pattern
is a relatively strong red candle and the general rule here is that we want the red candle to close below the
opening of the last candle right here but you can see that uh and this is very important in this particular case you
can see that if the red candle closes maybe around here you can see that the
real body of the the red candle uh would be very small and this is something we we don't want to see we want the red
candle to at least have a medium siiz real body so now let's take a look at
Bear Flag Trading Strategy
how to actually trade the bare flag as always we will take a look at the entry level the stop- loss and the target but
the first thing we need to do is of course to find the pattern and here on
the chart we can see that we have a very clear downtrend we are printing both consecutive lower highs and we're also
printing consecutive lower lows and here the most clear bare flag is this
movement right here as you can see before the pattern appeared we had a strong movement towards the downside
then we saw one two and three candles that went in the opposite direction once
again this candle this green candle right here preferably we want the real
body of this candle to be a little bit smaller but it's important to remember that markets are very seldom perfect so
this pattern right here is at least in my opinion good enough what we can also see here is that the last candle of the
pattern is a strong red candle that is a good sign and we can also see that the red candle clearly closes below the
opening of the last green candle as for your entry point the most common way to enter is to enter at the candle close of
the last Red candle for your stop- loss you usually want to place it above the
highest point of the pattern so this right here is the highest point of the pattern and you want to place your stop
loss uh just above that point when it comes to Target levels we have multiple options one way to set your target is to
actually set it already at this point right here but you can see in this case when we enter right here you can see
that the distance to the profit is very very small so in this case it might not
make sense to use this profit Target instead you can use something called the
100% measure move so you measure from the swing High to swing low before the
pattern then you take this exact measurement you copy the length and perhaps your profit Target would be
around this point so what's important here is that the length of this move and
the length to your target should be the same size all right so now it's time to
The Bullish Runaway Gap
take a look at the bullish runaway Gap pattern and this right here is a very
powerful pattern so make sure to really pay attention when it comes comes to the complexity for this pattern it's
actually pretty hard to categorize but I'm calling this a simple pattern Because the actual pattern itself
doesn't really consist of candlesticks but rather it consists of a gap however
the direction for this pattern is bullish and the type here is continuation so before the pattern
appears we want to see an uptrend then we identify the actual pattern and the
goal of this pattern is to continue to push the price towards the upside all right so identifying this pattern is
actually pretty simple all we need to look out for here is a move towards the upside and then we want to see a gap you
can see this right here the space in between the highest point of this candle
and the lowest point of this candle is considered a gap and this type of Gap
where we have nothing in between the candles you can see not even the Wicks are touching is called a true Gap so
what we're looking out for when it comes to the runway Gap here is that we want to see a true Gap so for example we
don't want it to look like this let's say that this right here is the first candle and this right here is the second
candle you can see that in this case we have a gap here between the real bodies of the candles so this right here is one
type of Gap but what we're looking out for here is that we want not even the Wicks to touch and this pattern is
confirmed already when this candle open opens so as you guys know for most
Candlestick patterns the patterns will confirm at a candle close but for the bullish runaway Gap the pattern confirms
at the open after the Gap and that is very important to have in mind so now let's take a look at the bullish runaway
Bullish Gap Trading Strategy
Gap trading strategy and the first thing we need to do here is of course to identify the pattern and on this chart
the only real runaway Gap that can be found is right here you can see if you
look closely on this chart you can see that we have multiple of these other gaps you can see for example right here
we have a gap between the real bodies of the candles and for example right here
as well and right here you can see that these other types of gaps when we have a gap between the real bodies is pretty
common but to find a gap where not even the Wicks are touching is a more rare signal another thing that is important
to notice here is that before the runaway Gap we need to see an uptrend and in this case we indeed saw an
uptrend before the Gap then the Gap appeared and remember the the pattern
confirms when this Candlestick opens so how do we trade this pattern well the
most common entry point is to enter here at the open after the Gap as for your
stop- loss you usually want to place the stop loss here below the lowest point of
the Gap so this black line is the lowest point of the Gap and a common way to set your stop loss is to place it below this
point uh why do we do this well it's not super uncommon for the price to actually
pull back and test the low of the Gap this right here is what we call a gap
fill and when we set the stop loss below this point we can actually allow for a gap fill and still not get stopped out
and as for your Target you can use a simple risk W ratio so you can measure this movement right here you can take
the measurement using a 2: one would give a Target around there using a 3:
one would give a Target around there so now let's switch to attention here and take a look at the bearish runaway Gap
The Bearish Runaway Gap
we can consider this pattern a simple pattern because it consists basically of zero candlesticks it depends on you know
how you define it but I Define this as a simple pattern the direction here is bearish and the type is continuation so
to identify the pattern we need to first see a downtrend what we then want to
identify is that we want to identify a true Gap so remember a true Gap is when
we have space in between two candles where not even the Wicks are touching
this pattern confirms already at the open of the Candlestick after the Gap so
this pattern is confirmed already at this point and it indicates a continuation to the downside so now then
Bearish Gap Trading Strategy
how do we trade The bearish Runaway Gap well the first thing we need to do is that we need to identify the Gap and if
you want to you can try to do this yourself and pause the video right now
well guys did you find any Gap um in my opinion the most obvious Gap can be found right here you can see we have
some complete space in between these two candles right so here we have a bearish
runaway Gap you could also maybe argue that we have a tiny tiny Gap right here
but preferably when we see these runaway gaps we don't really want to see very
small gaps like right here we definitely prefer to see larger gaps like in this
case as for your entry point the most common way to enter is to enter already at the open of the first candle after
the gap for the stop loss we usually place the stop loss just slightly above
the highest point of the Gap so the highest point of the Gap is right there and we place our stop loss just above
this point and we also leave some wiggle room so if the price goes up to retest
the Gap we still have some good chances here to not get stopped out and still be
within a winning trade for your Target you can use a risk reward ratio so you can measure from the stop loss to the
entry point you take this measurement and a 2:1 Target would give us a Target
down here while a 3:1 would give us a a Target all the way down here all right
Doji and Spinning Top Candles
guys so now it's time to switch the T and take a look at a very important
family of candlesticks and I'm talking about dogee and spinning top candles so
now let's spend a little bit of time talking about what these candles are and why they are so important so first of
all dogee and spinning toop candles are part of a specific group that we call
indecision candles and indecision candles indicate uncertainty in the
market and they can signal potential shifts in the sentiment and we will talk
more about that very soon and what's common about in decision candles is that these candles typically have small real
bodies and long Wicks and this reflects that neither the Bulls or the bars are
in full control and these type of candles can be useful in many different ways they can be used to identify
potential reversals and they can also be used to provide warning signals so for
example if you are in a trade whether you are trading long or short these dogey and spinning toop candles can give
us warning signs that it might be time to actually exit the trade and so on and
so on so now let's dive a little bit deeper into doy candles and as you can
Doji Candles (Classic, Long-Legged, Dragonfly, Gravestone, Four Price)
see here on the screen we have many different types of dogies they all have
different and pretty funny names uh but the most important part about the the DOI candle is that if you take a look at
the body of all the dois here you can see that the body is you know pretty
much only a line which means that the candles open uh during the candle it
moves up and down but the candle closes pretty much at the exact same level
where it opened however it is okay for ad do candle to have a very very slight
real body so it might look something like this but we do want to see the real body either being a complete line or
have a very very small real body and now let's talk a little bit about the different types of dois because
depending on where the real body is located the doy candles can actually be
either bullish or bearish so for the first candle the candle right here this is called a classic dogee and this is
where the price you know during the candle moves up and down but it go goes down here and closes pretty much in the
middle of the candle so the classic dogee indicates indecision or in other
words uncertainty in the market as for the next candle the longle dogee we can
see that the real body here has shifted a slight bit up uh you can also have a
long leg dogee where you have the body of the candle down here for example but
what's important to learn here is that the higher up the body is the more
bullish the candle will become and the lower the body the more bearish the doe candle
will become so a longleg doe can be either more bearish or more bullish
depending on where you find the body the next candle is called the dragonfly do
and you can see that this is a case where the real body has been pushed all
the way to the highest point of the candle so let's imagine how the price moved within this candle you can see
that the price opened all the way up here during the candle the bars managed
to push the price pretty far down but before the close of the candle the Bulls
took control once again and actually managed to push the price all the way up to the top so this makes it so that the
dragonfly dogee is actually considered a bullish candle however as with all
patterns it it's important where the candle actually appears so this pattern
if it comes off after an uptrend it doesn't really signal too much but if
you find a dragonfly dogee after a downtrend in this case it can actually
act as a reversal candle pretty similar to the hammer and as you know about the
hammer it indicates a reversal to the upside the next dogee candle the gravestone dogee is pretty much the
opposite of the dragonfly you can see in this case it open all the way down here the Bulls managed to push the price up
but for the close of the candle the bars took full control once again and managed
to push the price down to the opening price so this right here is a bearish reversal pattern especially if it comes
after an uptrend the last do candle is a very weird one it's uh you can't see it
right now let me actually move my camera so you can see the name the last candle here is called the four price DOI and
this one is not too important to learn because it's very rare it's very very rare to find this four price dogee in
the markets but this pattern is basically when the price opens and close at the same level and during the candle
it doesn't really move at all so this is one of these candles that definitely signal uncertainty um and often when you
see a four price dogee um they often indicate that you know this is something
we actually don't want to trade all right so now let's take a look at how we can trade using the dogee candle on this
Doji Candle Trading Strategy
particular chart you can see that we have a downtrend because we printed consecutive lower highs and we also
printed lower lows and you can see that after this massive bearish uh this was a
bearish momentum candle appeared you can actually see that we saw multiple
multiple DOI candles emerging and remember that dogee candles at least
regular dogee candles signals uncertainty so if you are in this short
trade or in other words if you are betting against the direction of the market and then you see these multiple do
candles up this can actually act as a warning signal and that you should perhaps at least sell some of your
position or at least you know proceed with caution if we take a close look at the doy candle right here you can
actually see that we had pretty much a dragonfly DOI right so if you are in a short trade this right here is
definitely a warning sign however it's important to notice here that this is not enough justification for a long
position and a reversal trade it's more like a signal to proceed with caution
and as you can see after this doy candles appeared the price didn't reverse to the upside but it also did
not continue the downtrend after the DOI candles we actually entered a trading range all right so last but definitely
Spinning Top Candles
not least let's also take a look here at the spinning top candles and the spinning top candle is very similar to
the dogee but the difference here is that for the spinning top candle we allow for larger real bodies so you can
see that all of these four examples are examples of spinning top candles and here compared to the doe candle we have
larger real bodies with that said in order to have spinning top candles we
still want the Wicks here of the candles to be larger than the real body so A
good rule of thumb here is that you want the wick both the upper and and the lower Wick to be at least bigger than
the real body but now you might wonder you know what about if we have a spinning top candle with a very long for
example lower Wick and you know a extremely short upper Wick isn't it this
right here a spinning top candle well you could consider this a spinning top
candle but if you look closely at this pattern you will see that this pattern is actually pretty much a hammer instead
so what we have a spinning top candle with either a very short upper or lower
week these patterns will actually act as you know Hammer pattern or you know shooting stars or hanging mans depending
on where the candles appear here on the chart but what does you know all of
these candles tell us about the price well once again they give us a similar meaning as the doy candle or in other
words they indicate indecision in the market that neither the Bulls or the bars are in control so if we see you
know multiple doie candles appearing you know that we're talking about a pretty uncertain market and that can act as a
signal to either Exit your trade or depending on the context it can actually act as potential reversals as well all
