# Team Documentation

This folder contains documentation organized by team member persona. Each folder stores recommendations and analysis from the corresponding `/ask-*` cursor commands.

## Team Members

- **[CTO](./CTO/)** - Strategic architecture, system design, and technical leadership perspectives
- **[Designer](./Designer/)** - Visual design, UI/UX patterns, and design system decisions
- **[Developer](./Developer/)** - Implementation plans, coding sessions, and technical execution
- **[Scalper](./Scalper/)** - Trading strategy, market analysis, and execution optimization perspectives

## How It Works

When you use `/ask-cto`, `/ask-designer`, `/ask-developer`, or `/ask-scalper`, the AI persona will:
1. Analyze your question in context of the codebase
2. Provide their expert recommendation
3. **Save the recommendation** to their designated folder with a timestamped filename

This creates a searchable knowledge base of decisions and rationale over time.
