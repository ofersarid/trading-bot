# Maintain Folder READMEs

Every folder should have a README.md that stays current with the code. Create new READMEs when missing, update existing ones when code changes.

## Ignored Folders

Skip these folders and their subfolders entirely:
- `.cursor`
- `.vscode`
- `Old`

## README Structure

Each README.md should include these sections (when applicable):

### Required Sections

1. **Purpose** - What this folder is for (1-2 sentences)
2. **Files** - Each file with a one-line description

### Optional Sections (add when relevant)

3. **Commands** - Terminal commands specific to this folder
4. **Architecture** - Mermaid flowchart showing component relationships
5. **Flow** - Mermaid sequence diagram showing process flows

## Content Guidelines

- Keep descriptions concise (one line per file)
- Use Mermaid flowcharts for architecture when folder has 3+ interconnected components
- Use Mermaid sequence diagrams when folder contains a multi-step process
- Omit sections that don't apply (don't add empty sections)

## Example README

```markdown
# Bot Core

Trading bot core logic and state management.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `engine.py` | Main trading loop and order execution |
| `state.py` | Portfolio state and position tracking |
| `signals.py` | Signal generation from indicators |

## Commands

```bash
# Run the bot in paper trading mode
python -m bot.core.engine --paper

# Run with debug logging
python -m bot.core.engine --debug
```

## Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Signals] --> B[Engine]
    B --> C[State]
    C --> D[Broker API]
```
```

## When to Create/Update

**Create README.md when:**
- New folder with 2+ files is created
- Existing folder has no README.md

**Update README.md when:**
- Files are added, removed, or renamed
- File purposes change significantly
- New commands are introduced
- Architecture changes

## Maintenance Process

1. **During changes**: Update README in the same folder you modified
2. **Walk up**: Check if parent folder READMEs need updates
3. **Before finishing**: Verify all touched folders have current READMEs

## Quality Checklist

Before considering a README complete:
- [ ] Purpose is clear in 1-2 sentences
- [ ] All files are listed with descriptions
- [ ] Commands section exists if folder has runnable scripts
- [ ] Mermaid diagrams added where they clarify relationships
- [ ] No stale references to deleted files
